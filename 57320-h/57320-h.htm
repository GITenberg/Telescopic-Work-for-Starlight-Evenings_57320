<p>It having been suggested by some kind friends that
a series of articles on “Telescopes and Telescopic
Work,” which I wrote for the ‘Journal of the
Liverpool Astronomical Society’ in 1887-8, should
be reprinted, I have undertaken the revision and rearrangement
of the papers alluded to. Certain other
contributions on “Large and Small Telescopes,”
“Planetary Observations,” and kindred subjects,
which I furnished to ‘The Observatory’ and other
scientific serials from time to time, have also been
included, and the material so much altered and
extended that it may be regarded as virtually new
matter. The work has outgrown my original intention,
but it proved so engrossing that it was found
difficult to ensure greater brevity.</p>

<p>The combination of different papers has possibly
had the effect of rendering the book more popular in
some parts than in others. This is not altogether
unintentional, for the aim has been to make the work
intelligible to general readers, while also containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
facts and figures useful to amateur astronomers. It
is merely intended as a contribution to popular astronomy,
and asserts no rivalry with existing works, many
of which are essentially different in plan. If any
excuse were, however, needed for the issue of this
volume it might be found in the rapid progress of
astronomy, which requires that new or revised works
should be published at short intervals in order to
represent existing knowledge.</p>

<p>The methods explained are approximate, and technical
points have been avoided with the view to
engage the interest of beginners who may find it the
stepping-stone to more advanced works and to more
precise methods. The object will be realized if
observers derive any encouragement from its descriptions
or value from its references, and the author
sincerely hopes that not a few of his readers will
experience the same degree of pleasure in observation
as he has done during many years.</p>

<p>No matter how humble the observer, or how
paltry the telescope, astronomy is capable of furnishing
an endless store of delight to its adherents. Its
influences are elevating, and many of its features
possess the charms of novelty as well as mystery.
Whoever contemplates the heavens with the right
spirit reaps both pleasure and profit, and many
amateurs find a welcome relaxation to the cares of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
business in the companionship of their telescopes on
“starlight evenings.”</p>

<p>The title chosen is not, perhaps, a comprehensive
one, but it covers most of the ground, and no apology
need be offered for dealing with one or two important
objects not strictly within its scope.</p>

<p>For many of the illustrations I must express my
indebtedness to the Editors of the ‘Observatory’ to
the Council of the R.A.S., to the proprietors of
‘Nature,’ to Messrs. Browning, Calver, Cooke &amp; Sons,
Elger, Gore, Horne Thornthwaite and Wood, Klein,
and other friends.</p>

<p>The markings on Venus and Jupiter as represented
on pages 150 and 180 have come out much darker
than was intended, but these illustrations may have
some value as showing the position and form of the
features delineated. It is difficult to reproduce
delicate planetary markings in precisely the same
characters as they are displayed in a good telescope.
The apparent orbits of the satellites of the planets,
delineated in figs. 41, 44, &amp;c., are liable to changes
depending on their variable position relatively to the
Earth, and the diagrams are merely intended to give
a good idea of these satellite systems.</p>

<p class="space-above">Plates I. and II. are views of the Observatory and
Instruments recently erected by Mr. Klein at Stanmore,
Middlesex, lat. 51° 36′ 57″ N., long. 0° 18′ 22″ W. The
height above sea-level is 262 feet. The telescope is a 20-inch
reflector by Calver, of 92 inches focus; the tube is, however,
152 inches long so as to cut off all extraneous rays. It is
mounted equatoreally, and is provided with a finder of 6
inches aperture—one of Tulley’s famous instruments a century
ago. The large telescope is fixed on a pillar of masonry 37
feet high, and weighing 115 tons. Mr. Klein proposes to
devote the resources of his establishment to astronomical
photography, and it has been provided with all the best appliances
for this purpose. The observatory is connected by
telephone with Mr. Klein’s private residence, and the timepieces
and recording instruments are all electrically connected
with a centre of observation in his study.</p>

<small><i>THE TELESCOPE, ITS INVENTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF ITS POWERS.</i></small></h2>


<p>The instrument which has so vastly extended our knowledge
of the Universe, which has enabled us to acquire observations
of remarkable precision, and supplied the materials
for many sublime speculations in Astronomy, was invented
early in the seventeenth century. Apart from its special
application as a means of exploring the heavens with a
capacity that is truly marvellous, it is a construction which
has also been utilized in certain other departments with
signal success. It provided mankind with a medium through
which to penetrate far beyond the reach of natural vision,
and to grasp objects and phenomena which had either eluded
detection altogether or had only been seen in dim and
uncertain characters. It has also proved a very efficient
instrument for various minor purposes of instruction and
recreation. The invention of the telescope formed a new
era in astronomy; and though, with a few exceptions, men
were slow at first in availing themselves of its far-seeing
resources, scepticism was soon swept aside and its value
became widely acknowledged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>But though the telescope was destined to effect work
of the utmost import, and to reach a very high degree of
excellence in after times, the result was achieved gradually.
Step by step its powers were enlarged and its qualities
perfected, and thus the stream of astronomical discovery
has been enabled to flow on, stimulated by every increase in
its capacity.</p>

<p>There is some question as to whom may be justly credited
with the discovery of its principles of construction.
Huygens, in his ‘Dioptrics,’ remarks:—“I should have
no hesitation in placing above all the rest of mankind the
individual who, solely by his own reflections, without the
aid of any fortuitous circumstances, should have achieved
the invention of the telescope.” There is reason to conclude,
however, that its discovery resulted from accident rather
than from theory. It is commonly supposed that Galileo
Galilei is entitled to precedence; but there is strong evidence
to show that he had been anticipated. In any case it must
be admitted that Galilei<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> had priority in successfully utilizing
its resources as a means of observational discovery; for he it
was who, first of all men, saw Jupiter’s satellites, the crescent
form of Venus, the mountains and craters on the Moon, and
announced them to an incredible world.</p>

<p>It has been supposed, and not without some basis of probability,
that a similar instrument to the telescope had been
employed by the ancients; for certain statements contained
in old historical records would suggest that the Greek philosophers
had some means of extending their knowledge
further than that permitted by the naked eye. Democritus
remarked that the Galaxy or “Milky Way” was nothing
but an assemblage of minute stars; and it has been asked,
How could he have derived this information but by instrumental
aid? It is very probable he gained the knowledge
by inferences having their source in close observation; for
anyone who attentively studies the face of the sky must
be naturally led to conclude that the appearance of the
“Milky Way” is induced by immense and irregular clus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>terings
of small stars. In certain regions of the heavens
there are clear indications of this: the eye is enabled to
glimpse some of the individual star-points, and to observe how
they blend and associate with the denser aggregations which
give rise to the milky whiteness of the Galaxy.</p>

<p>Refracting lenses, or “burning-glasses,” were known at a
very early period. A lens, roughly figured into a convex
shape and obviously intended for magnifying objects, has
been recovered from the ruins of Herculaneum, buried in the
ejections from Vesuvius in the year 79 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> Pliny and others
refer to lenses that burnt by refraction, and describe globules
of glass or crystal which, when exposed in the sun, transmit
sufficient heat to ignite combustible material. The ancients
undoubtedly used tubes in the conduct of their observations,
but no lenses seem to have been employed with them, and
their only utility consisted in the fact of their shutting out
the extraneous rays of light. But spectacles were certainly
known at an early period. Concave emeralds are said to
have been employed by Nero in witnessing the combats
of the gladiators, and they appear to have been the same
in effect as the spectacles worn by short-sighted people in
our own times. But the ancients supposed that the emerald
possessed inherent qualities specially helpful to vision, rather
than that its utility resulted simply from its concavity of
figure. In the 13th century spectacles were more generally
worn, and the theory of their construction understood.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the telescope did not come into use
until so long afterwards. Vague references were made to
such an instrument, or rather suggestions as to the possibilities
of its construction, which show that, although the
principle had perhaps been conceived, the idea was not
successfully put into practice. Roger Bacon, who flourished
in the 13th century, wrote in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> ‘<i lang="la">Opus Majus</i>’:—“Greater
things may be performed by refracted light, for, from the
foregoing principles, follows easily that the greatest objects
may be seen very small, the remote very near, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>.
For we can give transparent bodies such form and position
with respect to the eye and the object that the rays are
refracted and bent to where we like, so that we, under any
angle, see the objects near or far, and in that manner we can,
at a great distance, read the smallest letters, and we can
count atoms and sand-grains, on account of the greatness of
the angle under which they are seen.”</p>

<p>Fracastor, in a work published at Venice in 1538, states:—“If
we look through two eye-lenses, placed the one upon the
other, everything will appear larger and nearer.” He also
says:—“There are made certain eye-lenses of such a thickness
that if the moon or any other celestial body is viewed through
them they appear to be so near that their distance does not
exceed that of the steeples of public buildings.”</p>

<p>In other writings will also be found intimations as to the
important action of lenses; and it is hardly accountable that
a matter so valuable in its bearings was allowed to remain
without practical issues. The progressive tendency and the
faculty of invention must indeed have been in an incipient
stage, and contrasts strongly with the singular avidity with
which ideas are seized upon and realized in our own day.</p>

<p>Many important discoveries have resulted from pure accident;
and it has been stated that the first <i lang ="la">bonâ fide</i> telescope
had its origin in the following incident:—The children of a
spectacle-maker, Zachariah Jansen, of Middleberg, in Zealand,
were playing with some lenses, and it chanced that
they arranged two of them in such manner that, to their
astonishment, the weathercock of an adjoining church
appeared much enlarged and more distinct. Having mentioned
the curious fact to their father, he immediately turned
it to account, and, by fixing two lenses on a board, produced
the first telescope!</p>

<p>This view of the case is, however, a very doubtful one, and
the invention may with far greater probability be attributed
to Hans Lippersheim in 1608. Galilei has little claim to be
considered in this relation; for he admitted that in 1609 the
news reached him that a Dutchman had devised an appliance
capable of showing distant objects with remarkable clearness.
He thereupon set to work and experimented with so much
aptitude on the principles involved that he very soon produced
a telescope for himself. With this instrument he
detected the four satellites of Jupiter in 1610, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
successes shortly followed. Being naturally gratified with
the improvements he had effected in its construction, and
with the wonderful discoveries he had made by its use,
we can almost excuse the enthusiasm which prompted him to
attribute the invention to his own ingenuity. But while
according him the honour due to his sagacity in devoting this
instrument to such excellent work, we must not overlook the
fact that his claim to priority cannot be justified. Indeed,
that Galilei had usurped the title of inventor is mentioned in
letters which passed between the scientific men of that time.
Fuccari, writing to Kepler, says:—“Galileo wants to be
considered the inventor of the telescope, though he, as well as
I and others, first saw the telescope which a certain Dutchman
first brought with him to Venice, and although he has
only improved it very little.”</p>

<p>In a critical article by Dr. Doberck<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>, in which this letter
is quoted and the whole question reviewed with considerable
care, it is stated that Hans Lippersheim (also known as Jan
Lapprey), who was born in Wesel, but afterwards settled
at Middleberg, in the Netherlands, as a spectacle-maker, was
really the first to make a telescope, and the following facts
are quoted in confirmation:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>—“He solicited the States, as
early as the 2nd October, 1608, for a patent for thirty
years, or an annual pension for life, for the instrument he
had invented, promising then only to construct such instruments
for the Government. After inviting the inventor to
improve the instrument and alter it so that they could look
through it with both eyes at the same time, the States determined,
on the 4th October, that from every province one
deputy should be elected to try the apparatus and make terms
with him concerning the price. This committee declared on
the 6th October that it found the invention useful for the
country, and had offered the inventor 900 florins for the
instrument. He had at first asked 3000 florins for three
instruments of rock-crystal. He was then ordered to deliver
the instrument within a certain time, and the patent was
promised him on condition that he kept the invention secret.
Lapprey delivered the instrument in due time. He had
arranged it for both eyes, and it was found satisfactory; but
they forced him, against the agreement, to deliver two other
telescopes for the same money, and refused the patent because
it was evident that already several others had learned about
the invention.”</p>

<p>The material from which the glasses were figured appears
to have been quartz; and efforts were made to keep the
invention a profound secret, as it was thought it would prove
valuable for “strategetical purposes.” The cost of these
primitive binoculars was about £75 each.</p>

<p>It is singular that, after being allowed to rest so long, the
idea of telescopic construction should have been carried into
effect by several persons almost simultaneously, and that
doubts and disputes arose as to precedence. The probable
explanation is that to one individual only priority was really
due, but that, owing to the delays, the secret could not be
altogether concealed from two or three others who recognized
the importance of the discovery and at once entered
into competition with the original inventor. Each of these
fashioned his instrument in a slightly different manner,
though the principle was similar in all; and having in a
great measure to rely upon his individual faculties in completing
the task, he considered himself in the light of
an inventor and put forth claims accordingly. Not only
were attempts made to assume the position of inventor, but
there arose fraudulent claimants to some of the discoveries
which the instrument effected in the hands of Galilei.
Simon Marius, himself one of the very first to construct
a telescope and apply it to the examination of the heavenly
bodies, asserted that he had seen the satellites of Jupiter
on December 29, 1609, a few days before Galilei, who first
glimpsed them on January 7, 1610. Humboldt, in his
‘Physical Description of the Heavens,’ definitely ascribes
the discovery of these moons to Marius; but other authorities
uniformly reject the statement, and accord to Galilei
the full credit.</p>

<p>It is stated that Galilei’s first instrument magnified only
three times, but he so far managed to amplify its resources
that he was ultimately enabled to apply a power of 30. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
lenses consisted of a double-convex object-glass, and a small
double-concave eye-glass placed in front of the focal image
formed by the object-glass. The ordinary opera-glass is
constructed on a similar principle.</p>

<img src="images/1-00(1).jpg"  alt=""  />
<div class="caption">The Galilean Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>The discoveries which Galilei effected with this crude and
defective instrument caused a great sensation at the time.
He made them known through the medium of a publication
which he issued under the title of ‘<i lang ="la">Nuncius Siderus</i>,’ or ‘The
Messenger of the Stars.’ In that superstitious age great
ignorance prevailed, bigotry was dominant, and erroneous
views of the solar system were upheld and taught by authority.
We can therefore readily conceive that Galilei’s discoveries,
and the direct inferences he put upon them, being held antagonistic
to the ruling doctrines, would be received with
incredulity and opposition. His views were regarded as
heretical. In consequence of upholding the Copernican
system he suffered persecution, and had to resort to artifice
in the publication of his works. But the marvels revealed
by his telescope, though discredited at first, could not fail to
meet with final acceptance, for undeniable testimony to their
reality was soon forthcoming. They were not, however,
regarded until long afterwards as affirming the views enunciated
by their clever author. Ultimately the new astronomy,
based on the irrepressible evidence of the telescope, and clad
in all the habiliments of truth, took the place of the old fallacious
beliefs, to form an enduring monument to Copernicus
and Galilei, who spent their lives in advancing its cause.</p>

<p>No special developments in the construction of the telescope
appear to have taken place until nearly half a century
subsequent to its invention. Kepler suggested an instrument
formed of two convex lenses, and Scheiner and Huygens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
made telescopes on this principle in the middle of the 17th
century. Huygens found great advantage in the employment
of a compound eyepiece consisting of two convex lenses,
which corrected the spherical aberration, and, besides being
achromatic, gave a much larger field than the single lens.
This eyepiece, known as the “Huygenian,” still finds favour
with the makers of telescopes.</p>

</div>


<p>Huygens may be said to have inaugurated the era of <em>long</em>
telescopes. He erected instruments of 12 and 23 feet,
having an aperture of 2-1/3 inches and powers of 48, 50,
and 92. He afterwards produced one 123 feet in focal
length and 6 inches in aperture. Chief among his discoveries
were the largest satellite of Saturn (Titan) and
the true form of Saturn’s ring. Hevelius of Dantzic built
an instrument 150 feet long, which he fixed to a mast 90 feet
in height, and regulated by ropes and pulleys. Cassini, at
the Observatory at Paris, had telescopes by Campani of 86,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
100, and 136 French feet in length; but the highest powers
he used on these instruments do not appear to have exceeded
150 times. He made such good use of them as to discover
three of the satellites of Saturn and the black division in the
ring of that planet. The largest object-glasses employed by
Hevelius and Cassini were of 6, 7, and 8 inches diameter.
This was during the latter half of the 17th century. In
1712 Bradley made observations of Venus, and obtained
measures of the planet’s diameter, with a telescope no less
than 212 feet in focal length. The instruments alluded to
were manipulated with extreme difficulty, and observations
had to be conducted in a manner very trying to the
observer. Tubes were sometimes dispensed with, the object-glass
being fixed to a pole and its position controlled by
various contrivances—the observer being so far off, however,
that he required the services of a good lantern in order to
distinguish it!</p>

<p>The immoderate lengths of refracting-telescopes were
necessary, as partially avoiding the effects of chromatic
aberration occasioned by the different refrangibility of the
seven coloured rays which collectively make white light. In
other words, the coloured rays having various indices of refraction
cannot be brought to a coincident focus by transmission
through a single lens. Thus the red rays have a longer focus
than the violet rays, and the immediate effect of the different
refractions becomes apparent in the telescopic images, which
are fringed with colour and not sharply defined. High
magnifying powers serve to intensify the obstacle alluded
to, and thus the old observers found it imperative to employ
eye-glasses not beyond a certain degree of convexity. The
great focal lengths of their object-lenses enabled moderate
power to be obtained, though the eye-glass itself had a focus
of several inches and magnified very little.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton made many experiments upon colours,
and endeavoured to obviate the difficulties of chromatic aberration,
but erroneously concluded that it was not feasible.
He could devise no means to correct that dispersion of colour
which, in the telescopes of his day, so greatly detracted from
their effectiveness. His failure seems to have had a pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>judicial
effect in delaying the solution of the difficulty, which
was not accomplished until many years afterwards.</p>

<p>The idea of reflecting-telescopes received mention as early
as 1639; but it was not until 1663 that Gregory described
the instrument, formed of concave mirrors, which still bears
his name. He was not, however, proficient in mechanics,
and after some futile attempts to carry his theory into effect
the exertion was relinquished. In 1673 Cassegrain revived
the subject, and proposed a modification of the form pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>viously
indicated by Gregory. Instead of the small concave
mirror, he substituted a convex mirror placed nearer the
speculum; and this arrangement, though it made the telescope
shorter, had the disadvantage of displaying objects
in an inverted position. But the utility of these instruments
was not demonstrated in a practical form until 1674, when
Hooke, the clever mechanician, gave his attention to the subject
and constructed the first one that was made of the kind.</p>

</div>

<p>In the meantime (1672) Sir Isaac Newton had completed
with his own hands a reflecting-telescope of another pattern.
In this the rays from the large concave speculum were received
by a small plane mirror fixed centrally at the other
end of the tube, and inclined at an angle of 45°; so that the
image was directed at right angles through an opening in the
side, and there magnified by the eye-lens. But for a long
period little progress was effected in regard to reflecting-telescopes,
owing to the difficulty of procuring metal well
adapted for the making of specula.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1729 Mr. Chester Moor Hall applied himself to the
study of refracting-telescopes and discovered that, by a
combination of different glasses, the colouring of the images
might be eliminated. It is stated that Mr. Hall made several
achromatic glasses in 1733. A quarter of a century after this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
John Dollond independently arrived at the same result, and
took out a patent for achromatic telescopes. He found,
by experiments with prisms, that crown and flint glass
operated unequally in regard to the divergency of colours
induced by refraction; and, applying the principle further,
he obtained a virtually colourless telescope by assorting a
convex crown lens with a concave flint lens as the object-glass.
Dollond also made many instruments having triple
object-lenses, and in these it was supposed that previous
defects were altogether obliterated. Two convex lenses of
crown glass were combined with a concave lens of flint glass
placed between them.</p>

<p>Whether we regard Hall or Dollond as entitled to the
most praise in connection with this important advance, it
is certain that it was one the value of which could hardly be
overestimated. It may be said to have formed a new era in
practical astronomy. Instruments only 4 or 5 feet long
could now be made equally if not more effective than those
of 123 and 150 feet previously used by Huygens and
Hevelius. All the troubles incidental to these long unmanageable
machines now disappeared, and astronomers
were at once provided with a handy little telescope capable
of the finest performances.</p>

<div class="caption">Common Refracting-Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>Reflecting-telescopes also underwent marked improvements
in the eighteenth century. Short, the optician, who died in
1768, was deservedly celebrated for the excellent instruments
he made of the Gregorian form. Towards the latter part of
the century William Herschel, by indomitable perseverance,
figured a considerable number of specula. Some of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
were mounted as Newtonians; others were employed in the
form known as the “Front view,” in which a second mirror
is dispensed with altogether, and the rays from the large
concave speculum are thrown to the side of the tube and
direct to the eyepiece. This construction is often mentioned
as the “Herschelian,” but the idea had long before been
detailed by Le Maire. In 1728 he presented a paper to the
Académie des Sciences, giving his plans for a new reflecting-telescope.
He proposed to suppress the small flat speculum
in Newtonians, and “by giving the large concave speculum a
little inclination, he threw the image, formed in its focus, to
one side of the tube, where, an eye-glass magnifying it, the
observer viewed it, his back at the time being turned towards
the object in the heavens; thus the light lost in the Newtonian
telescope by the second reflexion was saved.”</p>

<div class="caption">The Le Mairean or Herschelian Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>After making several instruments of from 18 to 24 inches
aperture, Herschel began one of larger calibre, and it was
finished on August 28, 1789. The occasion was rendered
historical by the discovery of one of the faintest interior
satellites of Saturn, Enceladus. The large telescope had a
speculum 48 inches in diameter; the tube was made of
rolled or sheet iron, and it was 39 ft. 4 in. long and 4 ft. 10 in.
in diameter. It was by far the largest instrument the world
had seen up to that time; but it cannot be said to have
realized the expectations formed of its powers, for its
defining properties were evidently not on a par with its
space-penetrating power. Many of Herschel’s best observations
were made with much smaller instruments. The
large telescope, which was mounted in Herschel’s garden at
Slough, soon fell into comparative disuse, and, regarding it
as incapable of further usefulness, Sir John Herschel sealed
it up on January 1, 1840.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>During the next half-century we hear of no attempts being
made to surpass the large instrument which formed one of
the working-tools of Herschel. Then, however, Lord Rosse
entered the field, and in the ‘Philosophical Transactions’ for
1840 described a reflector of 3-feet diameter which he had
set up at his residence at Parsonstown, Ireland. In 1845
the same nobleman, distinguished alike for his scientific
attainments as for his generosity and urbanity of disposition,
erected another telescope, the large speculum of which was
6 feet in diameter, 5½ inches in thickness, and its weight
3 tons. Lord Rosse subsequently cast a duplicate speculum
of 6 feet and weighing 4 tons. In point of dimensions this
instrument far exceeded that of Herschel, and it is still
in use, retaining its character as the largest, though certainly
not the best, telescope in existence. Its tube is made of
1-inch deal, well bound together with iron hoops; it is
56 feet long and 7 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Mr. Lassell soon afterwards made large specula. He
erected one of 2-feet aperture and 20-feet focus at his
residence at Starfield, near Liverpool, and in 1861 mounted
one of 4-feet diameter and 37-feet focus. This instrument
was for some time usefully employed by him at Malta.
After Mr. Lassell’s return to England his great telescope
remained in a dismantled state for several years, and
ultimately the speculum was broken up and “consigned
to the crucible of the bell-founder.”</p>

<p>It is not a little remarkable that Herschel, Rosse, and
Lassell personally superintended and assisted in the construction
of the monster instruments with which their names
are so honourably associated.</p>

<p>In or about the year 1867 a telescope of the Cassegrainian
form, and having a metallic speculum 4 feet in diameter
and 28-feet focus, was completed by Grubb of Dublin for
the observatory at Melbourne. This instrument, which cost
something like £14,000, was found defective at first, though
the fault does not appear to have rested with the optician.</p>

<p>Up to this period specula were formed of a metal in which
copper and tin were largely represented. But the days of
metal specula were numbered. Leon Foucault, in the year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
1859, published a valuable memoir in which he described
the various ingenious methods he employed in figuring surfaces
of glass to the required curve. He furnished data for
determining accuracy of figure. Formerly opticians had
considerable trouble in deciding the quality of their newly-ground
specula or object-glasses. They found it expedient to
mount them temporarily, and then, by actual trial on difficult
objects, to judge of their efficiency. This involved labour and
occasioned delay, especially in the case of large instruments.
Foucault showed that crucial tests might be applied in the
workshop, and that glasses could be turned out of hand
without any misgivings as to their perfection of figure.</p>

<p>Foucault’s early experiments in parabolizing glass led him
to important results. By depositing a thin coating of silver
on his specula he obtained a reflective power far surpassing
that of metal. Thereafter metal was not thought of as a
suitable material for reflecting-telescopes. Silver-on-glass
mirrors immediately came into great request. The latter
undoubtedly possess a great superiority over metal, especially
as regards light-grasping power, the relative capacity
according to Sir J. Herschel being as ·824 to ·436. Glass
mirrors have also another advantage in being less heavy than
those of metal. It is true the silver film is not very durable,
but it can be renewed at any time with little trouble or
expense.</p>

<p>With of Hereford, and after him Calver of Chelmsford,
became noted for the excellency of their glass mirrors. They
were found nearly comparable to refractors of the same
aperture.</p>

<p>A tendency of the times was evidently in the direction
of large instruments. One of 47·2-inches aperture (for
which a sum of 190,000 francs was paid) was completed
by Martin in 1875 for the Paris Observatory, but its employment
since that year has not furnished a very successful
record. The largest instrument of the kind yet made has
a speculum 5 feet in diameter and 27½-feet focal length. It
was placed in position in September 1888, and was made
by the owner, Mr. Common, of Ealing, whose previous
instrument was a 37-inch glass reflector by Calver. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
5-foot telescope is undoubtedly of much greater capacity
than the colossal reflector of Lord Rosse, though it is not so
large.</p>

<p>Mr. Calver has recently figured a 50-inch mirror for
Sir H. Bessemer, but the mounting is not completed; and
he is expecting to make other large reflectors, viz. one over
5 feet in diameter and another over 3 feet. The late
Mr. Nasmyth also erected some fine instruments, and adopted
a combination of the Cassegrainian and Newtonian forms to
ensure greater convenience for the observer. Instead of permitting
the rays from the small convex mirror to return
through the large mirror, he diverted them through the side
of the tube by means of a flat mirror, as in Newtonians. But
this construction is not to be commended, because much light
is lost and defects increased by the additional mirror.</p>

<p>Smaller telescopes of the kind we have been referring to
have become extremely popular: and deservedly so. They
are likely to maintain their character in future years; for the
Newtonian form of instrument, besides being thoroughly
effective in critical work, is moderate in price and gives
images absolutely achromatic. Moreover, it is used with
a facility and ease which an experienced observer knows how
to appreciate. Whatever may be the altitude of the objects
under scrutiny, he is enabled to retain a perfectly convenient
and natural posture, and may pursue his work during long
intervals without any of the fatigue or discomfort incidental
to the use of certain other forms of instrument.</p>

<p>Returning now to refractors: many years elapsed after
Dollond patented his achromatic object-glass before it was
found feasible to construct these instruments of a size
sufficient to grasp faint and delicate objects. Opticians were
thwarted in their efforts to obtain glass of the requisite purity
for lenses, unless in small disks very few inches in diameter.
It is related that Dollond met with a pot of uncommonly
pure flint glass in 1760, but even with this advantage of
material he admitted that, after numerous attempts, he could
not provide really excellent object-glasses of more than
3-3/4-inches diameter. It may therefore be readily imagined
that a refractor of 4½ or 5-inches aperture was an instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
of great rarity and expense. Towards the latter part of the
18th century Tulley’s price was £275 for a 5-inch equatoreally
mounted.</p>

<div class="caption">10-inch Reflecting-Telescope on a German Equatoreal, by Calver.</div>
</div>

<p>In later years marked improvements were effected in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
manufacture of glass. A sign of this is apparent in the fact
that, in 1829, Sir James South was enabled to purchase a
12-inch lens. Four years before this the Dorpat telescope,
having an objective of 9½ inches, had created quite a sensation.
As time went on, still larger glasses were made. In
1862 Alvan Clark &amp; Sons, of New York, U.S.A., finished an
instrument of 18½-inches aperture, at a cost of £3700; and
in 1869 Cooke &amp; Sons mounted a 24·6-inch object-glass for
the late Mr. Newall, of Gateshead. The latter instrument
was much larger than any other refractor hitherto made, but
it was not long to maintain supremacy. One of 25·8 inches
and 29-feet focus was finished in 1872 by Alvan Clark &amp;
Sons for the Naval Observatory, Washington, at a cost of
£9000. Another, of similar size, was supplied by the same
firm to Mr. McCormick, U.S.A. Several important discoveries,
including the satellites of Mars, were effected with the
great Washington telescope. A few years later a 27-inch
was completed by Grubb for the Vienna Observatory, and
quite recently the four largest refractors ever made have
been placed in position and are actively employed in
various departments of work. These include a 29-inch by
Martin for the Paris Observatory, a 30-inch by Henry Bros.
for Nice, a 30-inch by A. Clark &amp; Sons for Pulkowa, and a
36-inch, also by A. Clark &amp; Sons, for the Lick Observatory
on Mount Hamilton in California. The latter has no rival in
point of size, though rumours are current that still larger
lenses are in contemplation. The tube of the 36-inch is
56 feet long and 3½ feet in diameter at the ends, but the diameter
is greater in the middle. It is placed within a great
dome 75 feet in diameter. The expense of the entire apparatus
is given as follows:—Cost of the dome, $56,850; of
the visual objective, $53,000; of the photographic objective,
$13,000; of the mounting, $42,000. Total, $164,850.
This noble instrument—due to the munificence of one individual,
the late Mr. James Lick, of Chicago, who bequeathed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
$700,000 for the purpose—may be regarded as the king of
refracting-telescopes. Placed on the summit of Mount
Hamilton, where the atmosphere is exceptionally favourable
for celestial observations, and utilized as its resources are by
some of the best observers in America, we may confidently
expect it to largely augment our knowledge of the heavenly
bodies.</p>

<p>The great development in the powers of both refracting
and reflecting-telescopes, as a means of astronomical discovery,
exemplifies in a remarkable degree the ever-increasing
resources and refinements of mechanical art.
In 1610 Galilei, from his window at Padua, first viewed
the moon and planets with his crude instrument having
a power of 3, and he achieved much during the remaining
years he lived, by increasing it tenfold, so that at last he
could magnify an object 30 times. Huygens laboured well
in the same field; and others who succeeded him formed links
in the chain of progress which has almost uninterruptedly
run through all the years separating Galilei’s time from our
own. The primitive efforts of the Florentine philosopher
appear to have had their sequel in the magnificent telescope
which has lately been erected under the pure sky of Mount
Hamilton. The capacity of this instrument relatively to that
of earlier ones may be judged from the fact that a power of
about 3300 times has lately been employed with success in
the measurement of a close and difficult double star. Could
Galilei but stand for a few moments at the eyepiece of this
great refractor, and contemplate the same objects which he
saw, nearly three centuries ago, through his imperfect
little glasses at Padua, he would be appalled at the splendid
achievements of modern science.</p>

<small><i>RELATIVE MERITS OF LARGE AND SMALL
TELESCOPES.</i></small></h2>


<p>The number of large telescopes having so greatly increased
in recent years, and there being every prospect that the
demand for such instruments will continue, it may be well to
consider their advantages as compared with those of much
inferior size. Object-glasses and specula will probably soon
be made of a diameter not hitherto attained; for it is
palpably one of the ambitions of the age to surpass all
previous efforts in the way of telescopic construction. There
are some who doubt that such enormous instruments are
really necessary, and question whether the results obtained
with them are sufficient return for the great expense involved
in their erection. Large instruments require large observatories;
and the latter must be at some distance from a
town, and in a locality where the atmosphere is favourable.
Nothing can be done with great aperture in the presence of
smoke and other vapours, which, as they cross the field,
become ruinous to definition. Moreover, a big instrument is
not to be manipulated with the same facility as a small one:
and when anything goes wrong with it, its rectification may
be a serious matter, owing to the size. Such telescopes need
constant attention if they would be kept in thorough working
order. On the other hand, small instruments involve little
outlay, they are very portable, and require little space. They
may be employed in or out of doors, according to the inclination
and convenience of the observer. They are controlled
with the greatest ease, and seldom get out of adjustment.
They are less susceptible to atmospheric influences than
larger instruments, and hence may be used more frequently
with success and at places by no means favourably situated in
this respect. Finally, their defining powers are of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
excellent character as to compensate in a measure for feeble
illumination.</p>

<p>In discussing this question it will be advisable to glance at
the performances of certain instruments of considerable size.</p>

<p>The introduction of really large glasses dates from a
century ago, when Sir W. Herschel mounted his reflector,
4 feet in aperture, at Slough. He discovered two of the
inner satellites of Saturn very soon after it was completed;
but apart from this the instrument seems to have achieved
little. Herschel remarked that on August 28, 1789, when he
brought the great instrument to the parallel of Saturn, he
saw the spots upon the planet better than he had ever seen
them before. The night was probably an exceptionally good
one, for we do not find this praise reiterated. Indeed,
Herschel appears to have practically discarded his large
instrument for others of less size. He found that with his
small specula of 7-ft. focus and 6·3-in. aperture he had
“light sufficient to see the belts of Saturn completely well,
and that here the maximum of distinctness might be much
easier obtained than where large apertures are concerned.”
Even in his sweeps for nebulæ he employed a speculum of
20-ft. focus and 18½-in. aperture in preference to his 4-ft.
instrument, though on objects of this nature light-grasping
power is essentially necessary. The labour and loss of time
involved in controlling the large telescope probably led to its
being laid aside for more ready means, though Herschel was
not the man to spare trouble when an object was to be
gained. His life was spent in gleaning new facts from the
sky; and had the 4-foot served his purpose better than
smaller instruments, no trifling obstacle would have deterred
him from its constant employment. But his aim was to
accomplish as much as possible in every available hour when
the stars were shining, and experience doubtless taught him
to rely chiefly upon his smaller appliances as being the most
serviceable. The Le Mairean form, or “Front view,” which
Herschel adopted for the large instrument may quite possibly
have been in some degree responsible for its bad definition.</p>

<div class="caption">Lord Rosse’s 6-foot Reflecting-Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>Lord Rosse’s 6-ft. reflector has now been used for nearly
half a century, and its results ought to furnish us with good
evidence as to the value of such instruments. It has done
important work on the nebulæ, especially in the re-observation
of the objects in Sir J. Herschel’s Catalogues of 1833 and
1864. To this instrument is due the discovery of spiral
nebulæ; and perhaps this achievement is its best. But when
we reflect on the length of its service, we are led to wonder
that so little has been accomplished. For thirty years the
satellites of Mars eluded its grasp, and then fell a prize to one
of the large American telescopes. The bright planets<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> have
been sometimes submitted to its powers, and careful drawings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
executed by good observers; but they show no extent of
detail beyond what may be discerned in a small telescope.
This does not necessarily impugn the figure of the large
speculum, the performance of which is entirely dependent
upon the condition of the air. The late Dr. Robinson, of
Armagh, who had the direction of the instrument for sometime,
wrote in 1871:—“A stream of heated air passing
before the telescope, the agitation and hygrometric state of
the atmosphere, and any differences of temperature between
the speculum and the air in the tube are all capable of
injuring or even destroying definition, though the speculum
were absolutely perfect. The effect of these disturbances is,
in reflectors, as the cube of their apertures; and hence there
are few hours in the year when the 6-foot can display its full
powers.” Another of the regular observers, Mr. G. J.
Stoney, wrote in 1878:—“The usual appearance [of the
double star γ<sup>2</sup> Andromedæ] with the best mirrors was a
single bright mass of blue light some seconds in diameter
and boiling violently.” On the best nights, however, “the
disturbance of the air would seem now and then suddenly to
cease for perhaps half a second, and the star would then
instantly become two very minute round specks of white
light, with an interval between which, from recollection, I
would estimate as equal to the diameter of either of them, or
perhaps slightly less. The instrument would have furnished
this appearance uninterruptedly if the state of the air had
permitted.” The present observer in charge, Dr. Boeddicker,
wrote the author in 1889:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>—“There can be no doubt that on
favourable nights the definition of the 6-foot is equal to that
of any instrument, as is fully shown by Dr. Copeland’s
drawings of Jupiter published in the ‘Monthly Notices’ for
March 1874. It appears to me, however, that the advantage
in going from the 3-foot to the 6-foot is not so great in the
case of planets as in the case of nebulæ; yet, as to the Moon,
the detail revealed by the 6-foot on a first-class night is
simply astounding. The large telescope is a Newtonian
mounted on a universal joint. For the outlying portions of
the great drawing of the Orion nebula it was used as a
Herschelian. As to powers profitably to be used, I find
no advantage in going beyond 600; yet formerly on short
occasions (not longer than perhaps 1 hour a night) very much
higher powers (over 1000) have been successfully employed
by my predecessors.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lassell’s 4-foot reflector was taken to Malta, and while
there its owner, assisted by Mr. Marth, discovered a large
number of nebulæ with it, but it appears to have done nothing
else. His 2-foot reflector, which he had employed in
previous years, seems to have been his most effective instrument;
for with this he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, the
two inner satellites of Uranus, Hyperion, the faintest satellite
of Saturn, and the only known satellite of Neptune. He also
was one of the first to distinguish the crape ring of Saturn.
Mr. Lassell had many years of experience in the use of large
reflectors; and in 1871 he wrote:—“There are formidable
and, I fear, insurmountable difficulties attending the construction
of telescopes of large size.... These are, primarily,
the errors and disturbances of the atmosphere and the flexure
of the object-glasses or specula. The visible errors of the
atmosphere are, I believe, generally in proportion to the
aperture of the telescope.... Up to the size [referring to
an 8-in. O.-G.] in question, seasons of tranquil sky may be
found when its errors are scarcely appreciable; but when we
go much beyond this limit (say to 2 feet and upwards), both
these difficulties become truly formidable. It is true that the
defect of flexure may be in some degree eliminated, but that
of atmospheric disturbance is quite unassailable. These circumstances
will always make large telescopes <em>proportionately</em>
less powerful than smaller ones; but notwithstanding these
disadvantages they will, on some heavenly objects, reveal
more than any small ones can.” Mr. Lassell’s last sentence
refers to “delineations of the forms of the fainter nebulæ,”
to “seeing the inner satellites of Uranus, the satellite of
Neptune, and the seventh satellite of Saturn.” He mentions
that, when at Malta, he “saw, in the 2-foot equatoreal, with
a power of 1027, the two components of γ<sup>2</sup> Andromedæ
distinctly separated to the distance of a neat diameter of the
smaller one. Now, no telescope of anything like 8-inches
diameter could exhibit the star in this style.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>The large Cooke refractor of 24·8-inches aperture, which
has been mounted for about twenty years at Gateshead, has
a singularly barren record. Its atmospheric surroundings
appear to have rendered it impotent. The owner of this fine
and costly instrument wrote the author in 1885:—“Atmosphere
has an immense deal to do with definition. I have
only had one fine night since 1870! I then saw what I have
never seen since.”</p>

<p>The Melbourne reflector of 4-feet aperture performed very
indifferently for some years, and little work was accomplished
with it. Latterly its performance has been more satisfactory;
excellent photographs of the Moon have been taken,
and it has been much employed in observations of nebulæ.
The speculum having recently become tarnished, it has been
dismounted for the purpose of being repolished.</p>

<p>The silver-on-glass reflector of 47·2-in. diameter, at the
Paris Observatory, was used for some years by M. Wolf, who
has also had the control of smaller telescopes. He was in a
favourable position to judge of their relative effectiveness.
In a lecture delivered at the Sardonne on March 6, 1886, he
said:—“During the years I have observed with the great
Parisian telescope I have found but one solitary night when
the mirror was perfect.” Further on, he adds:—“I have
observed a great deal with the two instruments [both reflectors]
of 15·7 inches and 47·2 inches. I have rarely found
any advantage in using the larger one when the object was
sufficiently luminous.” M. Wolf also avers that a refractor
of 15 inches or reflector of 15·7 inches will show everything
in the heavens that can be discovered by instruments of very
large aperture. He always found a telescope of 15·7-inch
aperture surpass one of 7·9 inches, but expresses himself confidently
that beyond about 15 inches increased aperture is no
gain.</p>

<p>The Washington refractor of 25·8 inches effected a splendid
success in Prof. Hall’s hands in 1877, when it revealed the
two satellites of Mars. But immediately afterwards these
minute bodies were shown in much smaller instruments;
whence it became obvious that their original discovery was
not entirely due to the grasp of the 25·8-inch telescope, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
in a measure to the astuteness displayed by Prof. Hall in the
search. A good observer had been associated with a good
telescope; and an inviting research having been undertaken,
it produced the natural result—an important success. The
same instrument, in the same hands, enabled the rotation-period
of Saturn to be accurately determined by means of a
white spot visible in December 1876 on the disk of the
planet, and which was subsequently seen by other observers
with smaller glasses. Good work in other directions has also
been accomplished at Washington, especially in observations
of double stars and faint satellites. But notwithstanding
these excellent performances, Prof. Hall expressed himself in
rather disparaging terms of his appliances, saying “the large
telescope does not show enough detail.” He gave a more
favourable report in 1888; for we find it stated that “the
objective retains its figure and polish well. By comparison
with several other objectives which Prof. Hall has had an
opportunity of seeing during recent years, he finds that the
glass is an excellent one.”</p>

<p>Prof. Young, who has charge of the 23-inch refractor
at Princeton, has also commented on the subject of the
definition of large telescopes. He says:—“The greater
susceptibility of large instruments to atmospheric disturbances
is most sadly true; and yet, on the whole, I find
also true what Mr. Clark told me would be the case on first
mounting our 23-inch instrument, that <em>I can almost always
see with the 23-inch everything I see with the 9½-inch under the
same atmospheric conditions, and see it better</em>,—if the seeing
is bad only a little better, if good immensely better.” Prof.
Young also mentioned that a power of 1200 on the 23-inch
“worked perfectly on Jupiter on two different evenings in
the spring of 1885 in bringing out fine details relating to the
red spot and showing the true forms of certain white dots on
the S. polar belt.”</p>

<p>The 26-inch refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory,
U. S. A., is successfully engaged in observations of
nebulæ, and many new objects of this character have been
found. It does not appear that the telescope is much used
for other purposes; so that we can attach no significance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the fact that important discoveries have not been made with
it in other departments.</p>

<p>The great Vienna refractor of 27-inches aperture “does not
seem to accomplish quite what was expected of it,” according
to Mr. Sawerthal, who recently visited the Observatory at
Währing, Vienna. The Director, Dr. Weiss, states in his
last report that “the 27-inch Grubb refractor has only been
occasionally used, when the objects were too faint for the
handier instruments.”</p>

<p>The still larger telescopes erected at the Observatories at
Pulkowa and Nice have so recently come into employment
that it would be premature to judge of their performance.
In the Annual Report from Pulkowa (1887) it is stated that
Dr. H. Struve was using the 30-inch refractor “in measuring
those of Burnham’s double stars which are only
seldom measurable with the ‘old 15-inch,’ together with
other stars of which measures are scarce. He made 460
measures in eight or nine months, as well as 166 micro metric
observations of the fainter satellites of Saturn and
15 of that of Neptune.” At Nice the 30-inch refractor was
employed by M. Perrotin in physical observations of Mars
in May and June 1888. The canal-shaped markings of
Schiaparelli were confirmed, and some of them were traced
“from the ocean of the southern hemisphere right across
both continents and seas up to the north polar ice-cap.”
The 30-inch also showed some remarkable changes in the
markings; but these were not confirmed at other observatories.
The telescope evidently revealed a considerable
amount of detail on this planet; whence we may infer that
its defining power is highly satisfactory.</p>

<p>The great Lick refractor, which appears to have been “first
directed to the heavens from its permanent home on Mount
Hamilton on the evening of January 3, 1888,” has been
found ample work by the zealous astronomers who have it in
charge. Prof. Holden, in speaking of it, says:—“It needs
peculiar conditions, but when all the conditions are favourable
its performance is superb.” Mr. Keeler, one of the observers,
writes that, on January 7, 1888, when Saturn was examined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
“he not only shone with the brilliancy due to the great size of
the objective, but the minutest details of his surface were
visible with wonderful distinctness. The outlines of the rings
were very sharply defined with a power of 1000.” Mr. Keeler
adds:—“According to my experience, there is a direct gain
in power with increase of aperture. The 12-inch equatoreal
brings to view objects entirely beyond the reach of the 6½-inch
telescope, and details almost beyond perception with the
12-inch are visible at a glance with the 36-inch equatoreal.
The great telescope is equal in defining power to the smaller
ones.” This is no small praise, and it must have been
extremely gratifying, not only to those who were immediately
associated with the construction of the telescope, but to astronomers
everywhere who were hoping to hear a satisfactory
report. In its practical results this instrument has not yet, it
is true, given us a discovery of any magnitude. It has disclosed
several very small stars in the trapezium of the Orion
nebula, some difficult double stars have been found and measured,
and some interesting work has been done on the planets
and nebulæ. Physical details have been observed in the ring
nebula, between β and γ Lyræ, which no other telescope has
ever reached before.</p>

<p>Mr. Common’s 5-foot reflector has been employed on
several objects. In the spring of 1889 Uranus was frequently
observed with it, and several minute points of light,
suspected to be new satellites, were picked up. Evidence
was obtained of a new satellite between Titania and Umbriel;
but bad weather and haze, combined with the low altitude of
Uranus, interfered with the complete success of the observations.
“With only moderate powers, Uranus does not show
a perfectly sharp disk. No markings are visible on it, and
nothing like a ring has been seen round it.” Mr. Common,
in a letter to the writer, dated November 9, 1889, says:—“The
5-foot has only been tried in an unfinished state as yet,
the mirror not being quite finished when put into the tube
last year. This was in order to gain experience and save the
season. It performed much better than I had hoped, and is
greatly superior to the 3-foot. I took some very fine photographs
with it last year. It has been refigured, or rather
completed, this summer, and has just been resilvered.” From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
this it is evident that Mr. Common’s large instrument has not
yet been fully tested; but it clearly gives promise of successful
results, and encourages the hope that it will exert an
influence on the progress of astronomy. Owing to the highly
reflective quality of silvered glass, the 5-foot speculum has a
far greater command of light (space-penetrating power) than
the great objective mounted at the Lick Observatory. Mr.
Common’s mirror may therefore be expected to grasp nebulæ,
stars, satellites, and comets which are of the last degree of
faintness and quite invisible in the Lick refractor. But we
must not forget that the latter instrument is certainly placed
in a better atmosphere, and that its action is not therefore
arrested in nearly the same degree by haze and undulations
of the air. With equal conditions, the great reflector at Ealing
would probably far surpass the large refractor we have referred
to, the latter having less than one third of the light-grasping
power of the former.</p>

<p>This rapid sketch of the performances of some of our finest
telescopes must suffice for the present in assisting us to
estimate their value as instruments of discovery. And it
must be admitted that, on the whole, these appliances have
been disappointing. The record of their successes is by no
means an extended one, and in some individual cases absolute
failure is unmistakable. We must judge of large glasses by
their revelations; their capacity must be estimated by results.
We often meet with glowing descriptions of colossal telescopes:
their advantages are specified and their performances
extolled to such a degree that expectation is raised to the
highest pitch. But it is not always that such praise is
justified by facts. The fruit of their employment is rarely
prolific to the extent anticipated, because the observers have
been defeated in their efforts by impediments which inseparably
attend the use of such huge constructions.</p>

<p>Our atmosphere is always in a state of unrest. Its condition
is subject to many variations. Heat, radiated or
evolved from terrestrial objects, rises in waves and floats
along with the wind. These vapours exercise a property
of refraction, with the result that, as they pass in front of
celestial objects, the latter at once become subject to a rapid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
series of contortions in detail. Their outlines appear tremulous,
and all the features are involved in a rippling effect
that seriously compromises the definition. Delicate markings
are quite effaced on a disk which is thus in a state of ebullition;
and on such occasions observers are rarely able to
attain their ends. Telescopic work is, in fact, best deferred
until a time when the air has become more tranquil. In
large instruments these disturbances are very troublesome, as
they increase proportionately with aperture. They are so
pronounced and so persistent as to practically annul the
advantage of considerable light-grasping power; for unless
the images are fairly well defined, mere brightness counts
for nothing. Reflectors are peculiarly susceptible to this
obstacle; moreover, the open tube, the fact that rays from
an object pass twice through its length, and that a certain
amount of heat radiated from the observer must travel across
the mouth of the tube all serve to impair the definition. A
speculum, to act well, must be of coincident temperature in
every part. This is not always the case, owing to the
variableness of the weather or to unequal exposure of the
speculum. Large refractors, though decidedly less liable to
atmospheric influences, are yet so much at the mercy of them
that one of the first and most important things discussed in
regard to a new instrument is that of a desirable site for it.</p>

<p>The great weight of large objectives and specula tends
to endanger the perfect consistency and durableness of their
figure, and imposes a severe strain upon their cellular mounting.
The glasses must obviously assume a variety of bearings
during active employment. This introduces a possible cause
of defective performance; for in some instances definition
has been found unequal, according to the position of the
glass. Specula are very likely to be affected in this manner,
as they are loosely deposited in their cells to allow of expansion,
and the adjustment is easily deranged. The slightest
flaw in the mounting of objectives immediately makes itself
apparent in faulty images. Special precautions are of course
taken to prevent flexure and other errors of the kind alluded
to, and modern adaptations may be said to have nearly eliminated
them; but there is always a little outstanding danger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
from the ease with which glasses may be distorted or their
adjustment become unsettled.</p>

<p>Another difficulty formerly urged against telescopes of
great size was the trouble of managing them; but this
objection can scarcely be applied to the fine instruments of
the present day, which are so contrived as to be nearly as
tractable as small ones. A century ago, glass of the requisite
purity for large objectives could not be obtained; but this
difficulty appears also to have quite disappeared. And the
process of figuring lenses of considerable diameter is now
effected with the same confidence and success as that of
greatly inferior sizes.</p>

<p>Let us now turn for a moment to the consideration of
small instruments, premising that in this category are
included all those up to about 12-inches aperture. Modern
advances have quite altered our ideas as to what may be
regarded as large and small telescopes. Sixty-five years
ago the Dorpat refractor, with a 9½-inch objective by Fraunhofer,
was considered a prodigy of its class; now it occupies
a very minor place relatively to the 30-inch and 36-inch
objectives at Nice, Pulkowa, and Mount Hamilton.</p>

<p>Prof. Hall remarked, in 1885:—“There is too much
scepticism on the part of those who are observing with
large instruments in regard to what can be seen with small
ones.” This is undoubtedly true; but a mere prejudice
or opinion of this sort cannot affect the question we are
discussing, as it is one essentially relying upon facts.</p>

<p>Small instruments have done a vast amount of useful work
in every field of astronomical observation. Even in the
realm of nebulæ, which, more than any other, requires great
penetrating power, D’Arrest showed what could be effected
with small aperture. Burnham, with only a 6-inch refractor,
has equally distinguished himself in another branch; for he
has discovered more double stars than any previous observer.
Dawes was one of the most successful amateurs of his day,
though his instrumental means never exceeded an 8-inch
glass. But we need not particularize further. It will be
best to get a general result from the collective evidence of
past years. We find that nearly all the comets, planetoids,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
double stars, &amp;c. owe their first detection to comparatively
small instruments. Our knowledge of sun-spots, lunar and
planetary features is also very largely derived from similar
sources. There is no department but what is indebted more
or less to the services of small telescopes: the good work
they have done is due to their excellent defining powers and
to the facility with which they may be used.</p>

<img src="images/i-00(9).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Refracting-Telescope, by Browning.</div>
</div>

<p>We have already said that the record of discoveries made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
with really large instruments is limited; but it should also
be remarked that until quite recently the number of such
instruments has been very small. And not always, perhaps,
have the best men had the control of them. Virtually the
observer himself constitutes the most important part of his
telescope: it is useless having a glass of great capacity at one
end of a tube, and a man of small capacity at the other. Two
different observers essentially alter the character of an
instrument, according to their individual skill in utilizing its
powers.</p>

<p>Large telescopes are invariably constructed for the special
purpose of discovering unknown orbs and gleaning new facts
from the firmament. But in attempting to carry out this
design, obstacles of a grave nature confront the observer.
The comparatively tranquil and sharply definite images seen
in small instruments disappear, and in their places forms are
presented much more brilliant and expansive, it is true,
but involved in glare and subject to constant agitation, which
serve to obliterate most of the details. The observer becomes
conscious that what he has gained in light has been lost in
definition. At times—perhaps on one occasion in fifty—this
experience is different; the atmosphere has apparently
assumed a state of quiescence, and objects are seen in
a great telescope with the same clearness of detail as in
smaller ones. It is then the observer fully realizes that
his instrument, though generally ineffective, is not itself
in fault, and that it would do valuable work were the
normal condition of the air suitable to the exercise of its
capacity.</p>

<p>Those who have effected discoveries with large instruments
have done so in spite of the impediment alluded to. Relying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
mainly upon great illuminating power, bad or indifferent
definition has been tolerated; and they have succeeded in
detecting minute satellites, faint nebulæ, clusters, and small
companions to double stars. Telescopes of great aperture are
at home in this kind of work. But when we come to consider
discoveries on the surfaces of the Sun, Moon, and
planets, the case is entirely different; the diligent use of
small appliances appears to have left little for the larger
constructions to do. There are some thousands of drawings
of the objects named, made by observers employing telescopes
from 3 up to 72 inches in diameter; and a careful inspection
shows that the smaller instruments have not been outdone in
this interesting field of observation. In point of fact they
rather appear to have had the advantage, and the reason
of this is perhaps sufficiently palpable. The details on a
bright planetary object are apt to become obliterated in the
glare of a large instrument. Even with a small telescope
objects like Venus and Jupiter are best seen at about the
time of sunset, and before their excessive brilliancy on the
dark sky is enabled to act prejudicially in effacing the
delicate markings. Probably this is one of the causes which,
in combination with the undulations of the atmosphere, have
restricted the discoveries of large instruments chiefly to faint
satellites, stars, and nebulæ.</p>

<p>Prof. Young ascribes many of the successes of small instruments
to exceptional cuteness of vision on the part of certain
observers, and to the fact that such instruments are so very
numerous and so diligently used that it is fair to conclude
they must reap the main harvest of discoveries. We must
remember that for every observer working with an aperture
of 18 inches and more, there are more than a hundred
employing objectives or specula of from 5 to 12 inches;
hence we may expect some notable instances of keen sight
amongst the latter. The success of men like Dawes and
others, who outstrip their contemporaries, and with small
glasses achieve phenomenal results, is to be ascribed partly to
good vision and partly to that natural aptitude and pertinacity
uniformly characteristic of the best observers. These
circumstances go far to explain the unproductiveness of large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
telescopes: in the race for distinction they are often distanced
by their more numerous and agile competitors.</p>

<p>The objections which applied to the large reflecting instruments
of Herschel, Lassell, and Rosse scarcely operate with
the same force in regard to the great refractors of the present
day, and for these reasons:—Refractors are somewhat less
sensitive to atmospheric disturbances than reflectors. The
modern instruments are mounted in much improved style, and
placed in localities selected for their reception. In fact, all
that the optician’s art can do to perfect such appliances has been
done, and Nature herself has been consulted as to essentials;
for we find the most powerful refractor of all erected on the
summit of Mount Hamilton, where the skies are clear and
Urania ever smiles invitingly.</p>

<p>Some observers who have obtained experience both with
large and small telescopes aver that, even on a bright planet,
they can see more, and often see it much better, with the
larger glasses. But we rarely, if ever, find them saying they
can discern anything which is absolutely beyond the reach of
small instruments. It would be much more satisfactory
evidence of the super-excellence of the former if definite
features could be detected which are quite beyond the
reach of telescopes of inferior size; but we seldom meet
with experiences of this kind, and the inference is obvious.</p>

<p>There is undoubtedly a certain aperture which combines in
itself sufficient light-grasping power with excellent definition.
It takes a position midway between great illuminating power
and bad definition on the one hand, and feeble illuminating
power and sharp definition on the other. Such an aperture
must form the best working instrument in an average situation
upon ordinary nights and ordinary objects. M. Wolf fixes this
aperture at about 15 inches, and he is probably near the
truth.</p>

<p>The quaint Dr. Kitchener, who, early in the present
century, made a number of trials with fifty-one telescopes,
entertained a very poor opinion of big instruments. In his
book on ‘Telescopes,’ he says:—“Immense telescopes are only
about as useful as the enormous spectacles suspended over
the doors of opticians.” ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> “Astronomical amateurs should
rather seek for <em>perfect</em> instruments than <em>large</em> ones. What
good can a great deal of bad light do?”</p>

<p>We shall be in a better position a few years hence to
estimate the value of great telescopes; for the principal
instruments of this class have only been completed a short
time. Judging from the statements of some of the observers,
who are men of the utmost probity and ability, certain of the
large instruments are capable of work far in advance of
anything hitherto done. Definition, they say, is excellent,
notwithstanding the great increase of aperture. The old
stumbling-block appears, therefore, to have been removed,
and astronomy is to be congratulated on the acquirement of
such vastly improved implements of research. Even should
the large telescopes continue to prove disappointing in certain
branches, they may certainly be expected to maintain their
advantage in others. They will always be valuable as a corrective
to smaller and handier instruments. For special lines
of work in which very small or very faint objects are concerned,
considerable light-grasping power is absolutely
required; and it is chiefly in these departments that large
instruments may be further expected to augment our knowledge.
In photographic and spectroscopic work they also
have a special value, which late researches have brought prominently
to the fore.</p>

<p>The telescopes of the future will probably surpass in
dimensions those of our own day. The University of
Los Angelos, in California, propose to erect a 42-inch
refractor on the summit of Wilson’s Peak of the Sierra
Madre mountains, which is 6000 feet high and about
25 miles from Los Angelos. In reference to this contemplated
extension of size, it may be opportune to mention
that large objectives do not transmit light proportionately
with their increased diameter, owing to greater thickness of
the lenses, which increases the absorption. The Washington
objective of 25·8-inch aperture is 2·87 inches in thickness,
and more than half the light which falls upon it is lost by
absorption. On the other hand, specula, with every enlargement
of aperture, give proportionately more light-grasping
power, and their diameters might be greatly increased but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the mechanical obstacles in the way of their construction.
Mr. Ranyard expresses the opinion that “with the refractor
we are fast approaching the practical limit of size.” After
referring to the Washington object-glass as above, he says:—“If
we double the thickness, more than three quarters of the
light would be absorbed and less than one quarter would be
transmitted. The greatest loss of light is only for the centre
of the object-glass; but in all parts the absorption is quadrupled
for a lens of double aperture.” If, therefore, future
years see any great development in the sizes of telescopes, it
will probably be in connection with reflectors; for the loss
of light by absorption in the thick lenses of large refractors
must ultimately determine their limits. Mr. Calver says:—“The
light of reflectors exceeding 18 inches in diameter is
certainly greater than that of refractors of equal size, and for
anything like 3 feet very much greater.” He nearly obtained
the order for a monster reflector for the Lick Observatory,
the Americans admitting that the reflector must be the instrument
of the future for power and light because there were
practically no limits to its size. But the reflector has not
been much used in America, and therefore is little known.
For this reason the authorities decided to erect a large
refractor, and they appear to have been justified in their
selection, for the 36-inch objective has proved excellent.</p>

<p><i>Choice of Telescopes.</i>—The subject of the choice of telescopes
has exercised every astronomer more or less, and the question
as to the best form of instrument is one which has occasioned
endless controversy. The decision is an important one to
amateurs, who at the outset of their observing careers require
the most efficient instruments obtainable at reasonable cost.
It is useless applying to scientific friends who, influenced by
different tastes, will give an amount of contradictory advice
that will be very perplexing. Some invariably recommend a
small refractor and unjustly disparage reflectors, as not only
unfitted for very delicate work, but as constantly needing
re-adjustment and resilvering<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>.</p>

<p>Others will advise a moderate-sized reflector as affording
wonderfully fine views of the Moon and planets. The
question of cost is greatly in favour of the latter construction,
and, all things considered, it may claim an unquestionable
advantage. A man who has decided to spend a small sum
for the purpose not merely of gratifying his curiosity but of
doing really serviceable work, must adopt the reflector,
because refractors of, say, 5 inches and upwards are far too
costly, and become enormously expensive as the diameter
increases. This is not the case with reflectors; they come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
within the reach of all, and may indeed be constructed by the
observer himself with a little patience and ingenuity.</p>

<p><i>Refractors and Reflectors.</i>—The relative merits of refractors
and reflectors<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> have been so frequently compared and discussed
that we have no desire to re-open the question here.
These comparisons have been rarely free from bias, or sufficiently
complete to afford really conclusive evidence either way.
There is no doubt that each form of instrument possesses its
special advantages: aperture for aperture the refractor is
acknowledged to be superior in light-grasping power, but the
ratio given by different observers is not quite concordant. A
silver-on-glass mirror of 8-inches aperture is certainly equal
to a 7-inch objective in this respect, while as regards dividing
power and the definition of planetary markings, the reflector
is equal to a refractor of the same aperture. The much
shorter focal length of the reflector is an advantage not to be
overlooked. A century ago Sir W. Herschel figured his
specula to foci of more than a foot to every inch of aperture,
except in the case of his largest instruments. Thus he made
specula of 18½-inches and 24-inches diameter, the former of
which had a focal length of 20 feet and the latter of 25 feet.
The glass mirrors of the present time are much shorter, and
the change has not proved incompatible with excellent
performance. Calver has made two good mirrors of 17-1/4-inches
aperture, and only 8 ft. 4 in. focus. Mr. Common’s
5-foot mirror is only 27½ feet, so that in these instances the
length of the tube is less than six times the diameter.</p>

<img src="images/i-00(10).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">“The Popular Reflector” by Calver.</div>
</div>

<p>It has long been proved that refractors and reflectors alike
are, in good hands, capable of producing equally good results;
and we may depend upon it that, in spite of all argument
and experiment, both kinds of telescope will continue to hold
their own until superseded by a new combination, which
hardly seems likely. If the observer is free from prejudice,
he will have no cause to deplore the character of his instrument,
always supposing it to be by a good maker. Be it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
object-glass or speculum, he will rarely find it lacking in
effectiveness. It happens only too often that the telescope or
the atmosphere is hastily blamed when the fault rests with the
observer himself. Let him be persistent in waiting opportunities,
and let the instrument be nicely adjusted and in good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
condition, and in the great majority of cases it will perform
all that can reasonably be expected of it.</p>

<p>In choosing appliances for observational purposes, the
observer will of course be guided by his means and requirements.
If his inclination lead him to enter a particular
department of research, he will take care to provide himself
with such instruments as are specially applicable to the work
in hand. Modern opticians have effected so many improvements,
and brought out so many special aids to smooth the
way of an observer, that it matters little in which direction he
advances; he will scarcely find his progress impeded by want
of suitable apparatus. In size, as also in character, the
observer should be careful to discriminate as to what is really
essential. Large instruments and high powers are not
necessary to show what can be sufficiently well seen in a small
telescope with moderate power. Of course there is nothing
like experience in such matters, and practice soon renders one
more or less proficient in applying the best available means.</p>

<p>An amateur who really wants a competent instrument and
has to consider cost, will do well to purchase a Newtonian
reflector. A 4½-inch refractor will cost about as much as a
10-inch reflector, but, as a working tool, the latter will possess
a great advantage. A small refractor, if a good one, will do
wonders, and is a very handy appliance, but it will not have
sufficient grasp of light for it to be thoroughly serviceable on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
faint objects. Anyone who is hesitating in his choice should
look at the cluster about χ Persei through instruments such
as alluded to, and he will be astonished at the vast difference
in favour of the reflector. For viewing sun-spots and certain
lunar objects small refractors are very effective, and star-images
are usually better seen than in reflectors, but the latter are
much preferable for general work on account of three important
advantages, viz., cheapness, illuminating power, and convenience
of observation. When high magnifiers are employed
on a refractor of small aperture, the images of planets become
very faint and dusky, so that details are lost.</p>

<p><i>Observer’s Aims.</i>—If the intending observer merely requires
a telescope to exhibit glimpses of the wonders which he has
seen portrayed in books, and has no intention of pursuing
the subject further than as an occasional hobby, he will do
well to purchase a small refractor between 3 and 4 inches in
aperture. Such instruments are extremely effective on the
Sun and Moon, which are naturally the chief objects to attract
attention, and, apart from this, appliances of the size alluded
to may be conveniently used from an open window. The
latter is an important consideration to many persons; moreover,
a small telescope of this kind will reveal an astonishing
number of interesting objects in connection with the planets,
comets, &amp;c., and it may be employed by way of diversion upon
terrestrial landscape, as such instruments are almost invariably
provided with non-inverting eyepieces. Out-of-door observing
is inconvenient in many respects, and those who
procure a telescope merely to find a little recreation will soon
acknowledge a small refractor to be eminently adapted to their
purposes and conveniences.</p>

<p>Those who meditate going farther afield, and taking up
observation habitually as a means of acquiring practical knowledge,
and possibly of doing original work, will essentially
need different means. They will require reflectors of about 8
or 10 inches aperture; and, if mounted in the open on solid
ground, so much the better, as there will be a more expansive
view, and a freedom from heated currents, which renders an
apartment unsuited to observations, unless with small apertures
where the effects are scarcely appreciable. A reflector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
of the diameter mentioned will command sufficient grasp to
exhibit the more delicate features of planetary markings, and
will show many other difficult objects in which the sky
abounds. If the observer be specially interested in the
surface configuration of Mars and Jupiter he will find a
reflector a remarkably efficient instrument. On the Moon and
planets it is admitted that its performance is, if not superior,
equal to that of refractors. If, however, the inclination
of the observer leads him in the direction of double stars,
their discovery and measurement, he will perhaps find a
refractor more to be depended upon, though there is no
reason why a well-mounted reflector should not be successfully
employed in this branch; and the cost of a refractor of the
size to be really useful as an instrument of discovery must be
something very considerable—perhaps ten times as great as
that of a reflector of equal capacity. As far as my own
experience goes the refractor gives decidedly the best image
of a star. In the reflector, a bright star under moderately
high power is seen with rays extending right across the field,
and these appear to be caused by the supports of the flat.</p>

<p><i>Testing Telescopes.</i>—No amateur should buy an instrument,
especially a second-hand one, without testing it, and this is
a delicate process involving many points to be duly weighed.
Experience is of great service in such matters, and is, in fact,
absolutely necessary. Even old observers are sometimes
misled as to the real worth of a glass. In such cases, there is
nothing like having a reliable means of comparison, <i>i. e.</i>
another telescope of acknowledged excellence with which to
test the doubtful instrument. In the absence of such a standard
judgment will be more difficult, but with care a
satisfactory decision may be arrived at. The Moon is too easy
an object for the purpose of such trials; the observer should
rather select Venus or Jupiter. The former is, however, so
brilliant on a dark sky, and so much affected with glare,
that the image will almost sure to be faulty even if the glass
is a good one. Let the hour be either near sunrise or sunset,
and if the planet has a tolerably high altitude, her disk ought
to be seen beautifully sharp and white. Various powers
should be tried, increasing them each time, and it should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
noticed particularly whether the greater expansion of the
image ruins the definition or simply enfeebles the light. In
a thoroughly good glass faintness will come on without seriously
impairing the definite contour of the object viewed,
and the observer will realize that the indistinctness is merely
occasioned by the power being relatively in excess of the
light-grasp. But in a defective telescope, a press of magnifying
power at once brings out a mistiness and confuses the
details of the image in a very palpable manner. Try how he
will, the observer will find it impossible to get rid of this,
except, perhaps, by a “stop” which cuts off so much light
that the instrument is ineffective for the work required of it.
The blurred image is thought, at the moment of its first perception,
to be caused by the object being out of focus, and
the observer vainly endeavours to get a sharper image until
he finds the source of error lies elsewhere. A well-figured
glass ought to come very sharply to a focus. The slightest
turn of the adjusting-screw should make a sensible difference.
On the other hand, an inferior lens will permit a slight alteration
of focusing without affecting the distinctness, because
the rays from the image are not accurately thrown to a point.
Jupiter is also a good test. The limbs of the planet, if shown
clean and hard, and the belts, if they are pictured like the
finely cut details of an engraving, will at once stamp a telescope
as one of superior quality. Saturn can also be examined
though not, perhaps, so severe a test. The belts, crape ring,
Cassini’s division, ought to be revealed in any telescope of
moderate aperture. If, with regard to any of these objects,
the details apparently run into each other and there is a “fuzzy”
or woolly aspect about them which cannot be eliminated by
careful focusing, then either the atmosphere or the telescope
is in fault. If the former, another opportunity must be
awaited. An observer of experience will see at a glance
whether the cause lies in the air or the instrument. The
images will be agitated by obnoxious currents, if the defects
are due to the atmosphere, but if the glass itself is in error,
then the objects will be comparatively tranquil but merged
in hazy outlines, and a general lack of distinctness will be
apparent. Perhaps the best test of all as to the efficiency of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
a telescope is that of a moderately bright star, say of the 2nd
or 3rd magnitude. With a high power the image should be
very small, circular, and surrounded by two or three rings of
light lying perfectly concentric with each other. No rays,
wings, or extraneous appearance other than the diffraction
rings should appear.</p>

<p>This, however, specially applies to refractors, for in reflectors
the arms of the flat occasion rays from any bright star;
I have also seen them from Mars, but of course this does not
indicate an imperfect mirror. If there is any distortion on
one side of the image, then the lenses are inaccurately centred
though the instrument may be otherwise good, and a little
attention may soon set matters right. When testing a glass
the observer should choose objects at fairly high altitudes,
and not condemn a telescope from a single night’s work unless
the evidence is of unusually convincing character. If false
colour is seen in a silver-on-glass reflector it is originated
by the eyepiece, though not necessarily so in a refractor.
The object-glass of the latter will be sure to show some
uncorrected colour fringing a bright object. A good lens,
when exactly focused, exhibits a claret tint, but within the
focus purple is seen and beyond the focus green comes out.
In certain cases the secondary spectrum of an object-glass is so
inadequately corrected that the vivid colouring of the images
is sometimes attributed by inexperienced observers to a real
effect. A friend who used a 3-inch refractor once called on
me to have a glimpse of Jupiter through my 10-inch With-reflector.
On looking at the planet he at once exclaimed “But
where are the beautiful colours, Mr. Denning?” I replied
to his question by asking another, viz., “What colours?”
he answered, “Why, the bright colours I see round Jupiter
in my refractor?” I said, “Oh, they exist in your telescope
only!” He looked incredulous, and when he left me that
night did not seem altogether pleased with the appearance of
Jupiter shorn of his false hues!</p>

<p><i>Mounting.</i>—Too much care cannot be given to the mounting
of telescopes, for the most perfectly figured glass will be rendered
useless by an inefficient stand; a faulty lens, if thoroughly
well mounted, will do more than a really good one on a shaky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
or unmanageable mounting. Whatever form is adopted, the
arrangement should ensure the utmost steadiness, combined
with every facility for readily following objects. A man who
has every now and then to undergo a great physical exertion
in bodily shifting the instrument is rendered unfit for delicate
work. The telescope should be provided with every requisite
for carrying on prolonged work with slight exertion on the
part of the observer. Unless the stand is firm there will be
persistent vibrations, especially if the instrument is erected in
the open, for there are very few nights in the year when the
air is quite calm. These contingencies should be provided
against with scrupulous attention if the observer would render
his telescope most effective for the display of its powers, and
avoid the constant annoyance that must otherwise follow.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Eyepieces.</i>—Good eyepieces are absolutely essential. Many
object-glasses and specula have been deprecated for errors
really originated by the eyepiece. Again, telescopes have
not unfrequently been blamed for failures through want of
discrimination in applying suitable powers. A consistent
adaptation of powers according to the aperture of the telescope,
the character of the object, the nature of the observation,
and the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time,
is necessary to ensure the best results. If it is required to
exhibit a general view of Jupiter and his satellites to a friend,
we must utilize a low power with a large field; if, on the
other hand, we desire to show the red spot and its configuration
in detail, we must apply the highest power that is
satisfactorily available. The <em>negative</em> or Huygenian eyepiece
is the one commonly used, and it forms good colourless images,
though the field is rather small. The <em>positive</em> or Ramsden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
eyepiece gives a flatter and larger field, but it is not often
achromatic. A Kellner eyepiece, the feature of which is a
very large field, is often serviceable in observations of nebulæ,
clusters, and comets. Telescopes are sometimes stated to
bear 100 to the inch on planets, but this is far beyond their
capacities even in the very best condition of air. Amateurs
soon find from experience that it is best to employ those
powers which afford the clearest and most comprehensive
views of the particular objects under scrutiny. Of course
when abnormally high powers are mentioned in connection
with an observation, they have an impressive sound, but this
is all, for they are practically useless for ordinary work. I
find that 40, or at the utmost 50 to the inch, is ample, and
generally beyond the capacities of my 10-inch reflector. A
Barlow lens used in front of the eyepiece raises the power
about one third, and thus a whole set of eyepieces may be
increased by its insertion. It is said to improve the definition,
while the loss of light is very trifling. I formerly used a
Barlow lens in all planetary observations, but finally dispensed
with it, as I concluded the improved distinctness did not
compensate for the fainter image. A great advantage, both
in light and definition, results from the employment of a
single lens as eyepiece. True, the field is very limited, and,
owing to the spherical aberration, the object so greatly
distorted near the edges that it must be kept near the centre,
but, on the whole, the superiority is most evident. By many
careful trials I find it possible to glimpse far more detail in
planetary markings than with the ordinary eyepiece. Dawes,
and other able observers, also found a great advantage in the
single lens, and Sir W. Herschel, more than a century ago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
expressed himself thus:—“I have tried both the double and
single lens eye-glass of equal powers, and always found that
the single eye-glass had much the superiority in light and
distinctness.”</p>

<p><i>Requisite Powers.</i>—For general purposes I believe three
eyepieces are all that is absolutely requisite, viz., a low power
with large field for sweeping up nebulæ and comets; a
moderate power for viewing the Moon and planets; and a
high power for double stars and the more delicate forms on
the planets. For a 3-inch refractor, eyepieces of about 15,
75, and 150 would be best, and for a 10-inch reflector 40,
150, and 300. For very difficult double stars a still higher
power will be occasionally useful, say 250 for the refractor, and
500 for the reflector. The definition usually suffers so much
under high powers, and the tremors of the atmosphere are
brought out so conspicuously, that the greater expansion of the
image of a planet does not necessarily enable it to present
more observable detail. The features appear diluted and
merged in hazy outlines, and there is a lack of the bright,
sharply determinate forms so steadily recognized under lower
magnifiers. In special cases great power may become
essential, and, under certain favourable circumstances, will
prove really serviceable, but, in a general way, it is admitted
that the lowest power which shows an object well is always
the best. I have occasionally obtained very fair views of
Saturn with a power of 865, but find that I can perceive more
of the detail with 252. Some daylight observations of
Venus were also effected under very high power, and, though
the definition remained tolerably good, I found as the result
of careful comparison that less power answered more
satisfactorily. But it would be absurd to lay down inviolable
rules in such cases. Special instruments, objects,
and circumstances require special powers, and observers may
always determine with a little care and experience the most
eligible means to support their endeavours. One thing
should be particularly remembered, that the power used must
not be beyond the illuminating capacity of the instrument,
for planetary features appear so faint and shady under excessive
magnifiers that nothing is gained. To grasp details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
there must be a fair amount of light. I have seen more with
252 on my 10-inch reflector than with 350 on a 5-1/4-inch
refractor, because of the advantage from the brighter image
in the former case.</p>

<p><i>Overstating Powers.</i>—It seems to be a fashionable imposition
on the part of opticians to overstate magnifying
powers. Eyepieces are usually advertised at double their
true strength. My own 10-inch reflector was catalogued as
having four eyepieces, 100 to 600, but on trial I found the
highest was no more than 330. This custom of exaggerating
powers seems to have long been a privileged deception, and
persons buying telescopes ought to be guarded against it.
Dr. Kitchiner says it originated with the celebrated maker of
reflectors, James Short, and justly condemns it as a practice
which should be discontinued. I suppose it is thought that
high powers advertised in connection with a telescope have
an exalted sound and are calculated to attract the unwary
purchaser; but good instruments need no insidious trade
artifices to make them saleable. The practice does not affect
observers of experience, because it is well understood, and
they take good care to test their eyepieces directly they get
them. But the case is different with young and inexperienced
amateurs, who naturally enough accept the words of respectable
opticians, only to find, in many cases, that they have
been misleading and a source of considerable annoyance.</p>

<p><i>Method of finding the Power.</i>—The magnifying power of a
telescope may be determined by dividing the focal length of
the object-glass or mirror by the focal length of the eye-lens.
Thus, if the large glass has a focus of 70 inches and the eye-lens
a focus of one inch, then the power is 70. If the latter
is only 1/4-inch focus, the resulting power will be 280. But
this method is only applicable to single lens eyepieces. We
may, however, resort to several other means of finding the
powers of the compound eyepieces of Huygens or Ramsden.
Let the observer fix a slip of white cardboard, say 1 inch
wide, to a door or post some distance off, and then (with a
refractor) view it, while keeping the disengaged eye open, and
note the exact space covered by the telescopic image of the
card as projected on the door seen by the other eye. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
number of inches included in the space alluded to will represent
the linear magnifying power. A brick wall or any
surface with distinct, regularly marked divisions will answer
the same purpose, the number of bricks or divisions covered
by the telescopic image of one of them being equivalent to
the power. But it should not be forgotten that a telescope
magnifies slightly less upon a celestial object than upon a
near terrestrial one owing to the shorter focus, and a trifling
allowance will have to be made for this. Another plan may
be mentioned. When the telescope is directed to any fairly
bright object or to the sky, and the observer removes his eye
about 10 inches from the eyepiece, a sharply defined, bright
little disk will be perceived in the eye-lens. If the diameter
of this disk is ascertained and the clear aperture of the object-glass
or mirror is divided by it, the quotient will be the
magnifying power. Thus, if the small circle of light is ·2
inch diameter and the effective aperture of the large glass
5 inches, then the power is 25. If the former is ·02 inch diameter
and the latter 7·5 inches, the power will be 375. The
dynamometer is a little instrument specially designed to facilitate
this means of fixing the magnifying power. It enables
the diameter of the small luminous circle in the eye-lens to be
very accurately measured, and this is a most important factor
in deriving the power by this method.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Field of Eyepiece.</i>—Observers often require to know the
diameter of the fields of their eyepieces. Those engaged in
sweeping up comets, nebulæ, or other objects requiring large
fields and low powers, find it quite important to have this
information. They may acquire it for themselves by simple
methods. A planet, or star such as δ Orionis, η or γ Virginis,
or η Aquilæ, close to the equator, should be allowed to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
exactly through the centre of the field, and the interval
occupied in its complete transit from ingress to egress noted
several times. The mean result in min. and sec. of time
must then be multiplied by 15, and this will represent the
diameter required in min. and sec. of arc on the equator.
A planet or star near the meridian is the best for the purpose.
If the object occupies 1 min. 27 sec. of time in passing from
the E. to the W. limit of the field, then 87 sec. × 15 = 1305″,
or 21′ 45″. A more accurate method of deriving the angle
subtended by the field is to let a star, say Regulus, pass
through the centre, and fix the time which lapses in its entire
passage by a sidereal clock; then the interval so found
× 15 × cosine of the declination of Regulus will indicate the
diameter of the field. Suppose for instance, that the star
named occupies 2 min. 14 sec. = 134 sec. in its passage right
across the whole and central part of the field: then</p>

<p><i>Limited Means no Obstacle.</i>—There are many observers who,
having limited means, are apt to consider themselves practically
unable to effect good work. This is a great illusion.
There are several branches of astronomy in which the diligent
use of a small instrument may be turned to excellent account.
Perseverance will often compensate for lack of powerful
appliances. Many of the large and expensive telescopes, now
becoming so common, are engaged in work which could be as
well performed with smaller aperture, and when the manifold
advantages of moderate instruments are considered, amateurs
may well cease to deplore the apparent insufficiency of their
apparatus. It is, however, true that refractors have now
attained dimensions and a degree of proficiency never contemplated
in former times, and that the modern ingenuity of art
has given birth to innumerable devices to facilitate the work
of those engaged in observation. In many of our best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
appointed observatories the arrangements are so very replete
with conveniences, and so sedatory in their influences, that the
observer has every inducement to fall asleep, though we do
not find instances of “nodding” recorded in their annals.
Further progress in the same direction leads us to joyfully
anticipate the time when, instead of standing out in the frost,
we may comfortably make our observations in bed. This
will admirably suit all those who, like Bristol people, are reported
to sleep with one eye open! But, to be more serious,
the work of amateurs is much hindered by lack of means to
construct observatories wherein they may conduct researches
without suffering from all the rigours of an unfavourable
climate. Many of them have, like William Herschel a
century ago, to pursue their labours under no canopy but
the heavens above, and are exposed to all the trying severity
of frost and keen winds, which keep them shivering for hours
together, and very much awake!</p>

<p><i>Observing-Seats.</i>—As to observing-seats, many useful contrivances
have been described from time to time in the
‘Astronomical Register’ and ‘English Mechanic.’ Some of
these answer their design admirably, but I believe a good chair,
embodying all the many little requirements of the observer,
yet awaits construction. Those I have seen, while supplying
certain acknowledged wants, are yet deficient in some points
which need provision. With my reflector I find an ordinary
step-ladder answers the purpose very well. It is at once
light, simple, and durable, and enables observations to be
secured at any altitude. It may be readily placed so that the
observer can work in a sitting posture, and the upper shelves,
while convenient to lean upon, may be so arranged as to hold
eyepieces, and are to be further utilized when making drawings
at the telescope. I find it possible to obtain very steady
views of celestial objects in this way. Everyone knows that
during a critical observation it is as essential for the observer
to be perfectly still as it is for the instrument to be free from
vibration. A person who stands looking through a telescope
feels a desire to ensure a convenient stability by catching hold
of it. The impression is no doubt correctly conveyed to his
mind that he may obtain a better view in this way; and so he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
would, were it not for the dancing of the image which instantly
follows the handling of the instrument. For this
reason it is absolutely necessary that no part of the observer
touch the telescope while in use. He must ensure the desired
steadiness, which is really a most important consideration, by
other means; and an observer who provides for this contingency
will have taken a useful step in the way of achieving
delicate work.</p>

<p><i>Advantage of Equatoreals.</i>—Those who employ equatoreal
mounting and clock-work will manifestly command an
advantage in tracing features on a planet or other object
requiring critical scrutiny. Common stands, though often
good make-shifts, require constant application on the part of
the observer, when his undivided attention should be concentrated
on the object. With an alt-azimuth stand nearly
one half the observer’s time is occupied in keeping the object
near the middle of the field. Though good views are
obtainable, they are very fugitive. Just as the delicate
features are being impressed on the retina they are lost in
the ill-defined margin of the field, or from the necessity of
suddenly shifting the object back. A succession of hurried
views of this kind, during which the observer is frantically
endeavouring to grasp details which only require a steady
view to be well displayed, are often tantalizing and seldom
satisfactory in their issues. This is especially the case when
a single lens and high powers are used, and if the night is
windy the difficulty is intensified. It is, therefore, evident
that a clock-driven telescope possesses marked advantages in
delicate work on faint objects, because the prolonged view
better enables the eye to gather in the details which are all
but lost in the elusive glimpses afforded by inferior means.
Still we must not forget that rough appliances do not present
an effectual barrier to success. The very finest definition
comes only in momentary glimpses. The sharply-cut outlines
of planetary configuration cannot steadily be held for
long together. Only now and then the image acquires the
distinctness of an engraving, when the air and the focus of
eye and telescope severally combine to produce a perfect
picture. Observers, therefore, whose instruments are simply,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
though perhaps substantially mounted in handy fashion, must
profit by these moments of fine seeing, and, when drawing, will
find it expedient to fill in, little by little, the delicate forms
which reach the eye. This will take much time owing to the
drawbacks alluded to, but the outcome will more than justify
its expenditure, and the observer will gain patience and
perseverance which will prove a useful experience in the
future.</p>

<p>Lenses out of centre or misplaced are, like other defects,
calculated to give rise to errors as numerous as they are
various. But the most striking of these apparently belong
to a period when telescopes were far less perfect and popular
than at the present day. Indeed, it is surprising that so
very few false or imaginary discoveries are announced when
we consider the vast array of instruments that are now employed.
It is true we occasionally hear that a comet has been
discovered close to Jupiter, that several companions have been
seen to Polaris, or that some other extraordinary “find” has
been effected, but the age is dead when such announcements
were accepted without suitable investigation. The satellite of
Venus has long since ceased to exist. The active volcanoes
on the Moon have become extinct. Even Vulcan will have
to be set aside, and, like many another sensation which caused
quite a <i lang="fr">furóre</i> in its day, must soon be altogether expunged
from the category of “suspects.”</p>

<p><i>Test-objects.</i> Opticians sometimes advertise lists of objects—generally
double stars—which may be seen with their instruments,
but it does not appear to be sufficiently understood
that the character of a telescope is dependent in a great
degree upon the ability of the observer, who can either make
or mar it, according to the skill he displays in its management.
Some men will undoubtedly see more with 5 inches
of aperture than others will with 10. Certain observers
appear to excel in detecting delicate planetary markings,
while others possess special aptitude for glimpsing minute
objects such as faint satellites, or <em>comites</em> to double stars, and
the explanation seems to be that partly by experience and
partly by differences in the sensitiveness of vision, exceptional
powers are sometimes acquired in each of these departments.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
The various test-objects which have been given by reliable
authorities, though representing average attainments, are not
applicable to the abnormal powers of vision possessed by
certain observers. In fact, the capacity of a telescope cannot
be correctly assigned and its powers circumscribed by arbitrary
rules, because, as already stated, the character of the
observer himself becomes a most important factor in this
relation. Climatic influences have also considerable weight,
though less so than the personal variations referred to, for
one man will succeed, where another meets with utter failure.
This is unquestionably due to differences in eyesight, method,
and experience. But whatever the primary causes may be,
everyone knows they induce widely discordant results, and
occasion many of the contradictions which become the subjects
of controversy. And, as a rule, amateurs should avoid controversy,
because it very rarely clears up a contested point.
There is argument and reiteration, but no mutual understanding
or settlement of the question at issue. It wastes
time, and often destroys that good feeling which should subsist
amongst astronomers of every class and nationality. In
cases where an important principle is involved, and discussion
promises to throw light upon it, the circumstances are quite
different. But paltry quibblings, fault-finding, or the constant
expression of negative views, peculiar to sceptics, should be
abandoned, as hindering rather than accelerating the progress
of science. Let observers continually exercise care and
discretion and satisfy themselves in every legitimate way as
to the accuracy of their results, and they may fearlessly give
them expression and overcome any objections made to their
acceptance. They should accord one another an equal desire
for the promotion of truth. Competition and rivalry in good
spirit increase enthusiasm, but there is little occasion for the
bitterness and spleen sometimes exhibited in scientific journals.
There are some men whose reputations do not rest upon good
or original work performed by themselves, but rather upon
the alacrity with which they discover grievances and upon
the care they will bestow in exposing trifling errors in the
writings of their not-infallible contemporaries. Such critics
would earn a more honourable title to regard were they to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
devote their time to some better method of serving the
cause of science.</p>

<p><i>Cheapness and increasing number of Telescopes.</i>—A marked
feature of optical instruments is their increasing cheapness.
Little more than half a century ago Tulley charged £315 for a
10-inch Newtonian reflector. At the present time Calver
asks £50 for an instrument of the same aperture, and sometimes
one may be picked up, second-hand, for half of that
amount. Not only have telescopes become cheaper, but they
have greatly improved in performance since silvered glass
superseded the metallic speculum. Hence we find moderately-powerful
instruments in the hands of a very large
number of observers. Astronomical publications have proportionately
increased, so that amateurs of to-day can boast
of facilities, both of making and recording observations, which
were scarcely dreamt of a century ago. It must be admitted,
however, that the results hardly do justice to the means available.
Such an enormous number of telescopes are variously
employed that one cannot avoid a feeling of surprise at the
comparative rarity of new discoveries, and, indeed, of published
observations generally. It is certain that the majority
of existing telescopes are either lying idle or applied in such
a desultory fashion as to virtually negative the value of the
results. Others, again, are indiscriminately employed upon
every diversity of object without special aim or method, and
with a mere desire to satisfy curiosity. Now it is to be greatly
deplored that so much observing strength is either latent or
misdirected. The circumstances obviously demand that an
earnest effort should be made to utilize and attract it into
suitable channels. To do this effectually, the value of collective
effort should be forcibly explained, the interest and
enthusiasm of observers must be aroused in a permanent
manner, and they must be banded together according to their
choice of subjects. An effort in this direction has been made
by the Liverpool Astronomical Society, and the results have
proved distinctly favourable; a considerable amount of useful
work has been effected in several branches and it forms the
subject of some valuable reports which have been annually
published in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> ‘Journal.’</p>

<p><i>Utility of Stops.</i>—There are a good many details connected
with observation which, though advice may be tendered in a
general way, are best left to the discrimination of observers,
who will very soon discover their influences by practical
trial and treat them accordingly. The employment of stops
or diaphragms to contract the aperture of telescopes is a
question on which a diversity of opinion has been expressed.
It is often found, on nights of indifferent seeing, that the
whole aperture, especially of a faulty instrument, gives bad
images, and that, by reducing it, definition becomes immensely
improved. But Mr. Burnham, the double star
observer, records his opinion that a good glass needs no contraction,
and that the whole aperture shows more than a part
unless there is defective figuring at the outer zone of the
lens, which will be cut off by the stop and its performance
thereby greatly improved. He seems to think that a glass
requiring contraction is essentially defective, but this is
totally opposed to the conclusions of other observers. It is
almost universally admitted that, on bad nights, the advantages
of a large aperture are neutralized by unsteady definition,
and that, by reducing the diameter, the character
of the images is enhanced. As regards instruments of
moderate calibre the necessity is less urgent. With my
10-inch reflector I rarely, if ever, employ stops, for by
reducing the aperture to 8 inches the gain in definition does
not sufficiently repay for the serious loss of light. But in the
case of large telescopes the conservation of light is not so
important, and a 14-inch or 16-inch stop may be frequently
employed on an 18-inch glass with striking advantage. The
theory that only defective lenses improve with contraction is
fallacious, for in certain cases where stops are regularly
employed it is found that, under circumstances of really good
seeing, the whole aperture gives images which are as nearly
perfect as possible. It is clear from this that the fault lies
with the atmosphere, and that under bad conditions it
becomes imperative to limit its interference consistently with
the retention of sufficient light to distinguish the object well.
In large reflectors, particularly, the undulations of the air
are very active in destroying definition, and the fact will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
patent enough to anyone who compares the images given in
widely different apertures. The hard, cleanly cut disks shown
by a small speculum or object-glass offer an attractive contrast
to the flaring, indefinite forms often seen in big telescopes.</p>

<p><i>Cleaning Lenses.</i>—As to wiping objectives or mirrors, this
should be performed not more often than absolute necessity
requires; and in any case the touches should be delicate and
made with materials of very soft texture. The owner of a
good objective should never take the handkerchief out of his
pocket and, in order to remove a little dust or dew, rub the
glass until the offensive deposit is thought to be removed.
Yet this is sometimes done, though frequent repetition of such
a process must ultimately ruin the best telescope notwithstanding
the hardness of the crown glass forming the outer
lens of the objective. It will not bear such “rough and
ready” usage and in time must show some ugly scratches
which will greatly affect its value though they may not
seriously detract from its practical utility. Good tools
deserve better treatment. When the glass really wants
cleaning, remove it from the tube and sweep its whole surface
gently with a dry camel’s-hair brush, or when this is not at
hand get a piece of linen and “flick” off the dust particles.
Then wipe the lens, as soon as these have been dislodged,
with an old silk, or soft cambric handkerchief; fine chamois
leather is also a good material, and soft tissue paper, aided
by the breath, has been recommended. But whatever substance
may be adopted it must be perfectly clean and free
from dust. When not in use it should be corked up in a
wide-necked bottle where it will be safe from contact with
foreign particles. In the case of mirrors there is an obvious
need that, when being repolished, the material used should be
perfectly dry and that the mirror also should be in the same
state. It is unnecessary to say here that in no case must the
silver film be touched when it is clouded over with moisture.
This must first be allowed to evaporate in a free current of
air or before a fire; the former is to be preferred. A
suitable polishing-pad may be made with a square piece of
washleather or chamois in which cotton-wool is placed and
then tied into a bag. This may be dipped into a little of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
finest rouge, and its employment will often restore a bright
surface to the mirror. But the latter should be left “severely
alone” unless there is urgent occasion to repolish it, as every
application of the rouged pad wears the film and may take off
minute parts of it, especially when dust has not been altogether
excluded. The precarious nature of the silvered surface
undoubtedly constitutes the greatest disadvantage of
modern reflectors. The polish on the old metallic mirrors
was far more durable. Some of Short’s, figured 150 years
ago, still exist and are apparently as bright as when they
were turned out of the workshop! I have a 4-inch Gregorian
by Watson which must be quite a century old, and both large
and small specula seem to have retained their pristine condition.</p>

<p>With regard to the duration of the silver-on-glass films,
much of course depends upon the care and means taken to
preserve them. Calver says that sometimes the deposit does
not last so long as expected, though he has known the same
films in use for ten years. A mirror that looks badly tarnished
and fit for nothing will often perform wonderfully
well. With my 10-inch in a sadly deteriorated state I have
obtained views of the Moon, Venus, and Jupiter that could
hardly be surpassed. The moderate reflection from a tarnished
mirror evidently improves the image of a bright
object by eliminating the glare and allowing the fainter
details to be readily seen. When not in use a tight-fitting
cap should always be placed over the mirror, and if a pad of
cotton wadding of the same diameter is made to inlay this
cap it tends to preserve the film by absorbing much of the
moisture that otherwise condenses on its surface. The ‘Hints
on Reflecting-Telescopes,’ by W. H. Thornthwaite and by
G. Calver, and the ‘Plea for Reflectors,’ by J. Browning, may
be instructively consulted by all those who use this form of
instrument. The latter work is now, however, out of print,
and Mr. Browning tells me that he has quite relinquished the
manufacture of reflecting-telescopes. Mr. G. With of Hereford,
who formerly supplied the mirrors for his instruments,
has recently disposed of his reserve stock and entered an
entirely different sphere of labour. In the publications above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
alluded to amateurs will find a large amount of practical
information on the value and treatment of glass mirrors.</p>

<p><i>Opera-Glass.</i>—A very useful adjunct, and often a really
valuable one to the astronomical amateur, is the Opera-Glass,
or rather the larger form of this instrument generally known
as the Field-Glass. Of certain objects it gives views which
cannot be surpassed, and it is especially useful in observations
of variable stars and large comets. Whenever the horizon is
being scanned for a glimpse of the fugitive Mercury, or when
it is desired to have a very early peep at the narrow crescent
of the young Moon, or to pick up Venus at midday, or Jupiter
before sunset, all one has to do is to sweep over the region
where the object is situated, when it is pretty sure to be
caught, and the unaided eye will probably reach it soon
afterwards. The opera-glass has the dignity of being the
first telescope invented, for even its binocular form is not
new; it is virtually the same pattern of instrument that was
introduced at Middleburg in 1609, though its compound
object-glasses are of more modern date. Anyone who entertains
any doubts as to the efficacy of the opera-glass or has
had little experience in its use will do well to look at the
Pleiades and compare the splendid aspect of that cluster, as
it is there presented, with the view obtained by the naked
eye, and he will acknowledge at once that it constitutes a tool
without which the observer’s equipment is by no means perfect.
The object-glasses should have diameters of 2 or 2½ inches,
and the magnifying power lie between 4 and 6. There is a
large field of view and the images are very bright. The
observer is enabled to enjoy the luxury of using both his eyes,
and when he directs the instrument upon a terrestrial landscape
he will be gratified that it does not turn the world upside down!
It is not surprising that an appliance, with recommendations
so significant, is coming more into favour every day, and for
those branches suitable to its means it is doing much useful
work. A volume has been recently published dealing expressly
with the use of the opera-glass in Astronomy; and in
the ‘Journal of the L.A.S.’ vol. vii. p. 120, there is an
excellent paper by Major Markwick on the same subject.
This instrument will never, of course, by the nature of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
construction, be comparable to a modern telescope in regard
to power, for Galilei, when he augmented his magnifiers to
30, appears to have practically exhausted the resources of
this appliance. But in all those departments requiring an
expansive field and little power with a brilliant and distinct
image, the larger form of opera-glass is a great desideratum,
and its portability is not one of the least of its advantages.</p>

<p><i>Dewing of Mirrors.</i>—The disposition of mirrors to become
clouded over upon rises of temperature is a point meriting
comment. When permanently left in a telescope, fully exposed
out of doors, the speculum undergoes daily transitions. The
heat generated in the interior of the tube by the sun’s action
causes a thick film of moisture to form upon the silvered
surface of the mirror, which remains in this state for a
considerable time, though the moisture evaporates before
the evening. The flat is similarly affected, and the result
of these frequent changes is that the coating of silver
becomes impaired and presents a crackly appearance all over
the surface. Sometimes when a marked increase of temperature
occurs towards evening the speculum is rendered
totally unserviceable until it has been submitted to what
Dr. Kitchiner terms a process of “roasting.” The vapour
will soon disappear when the mirror is brought indoors and
placed before a fire; but it is not till some time after it has
been remounted in the tube that it will perform satisfactorily.
Those who keep their mirrors in more equable temperatures
will not experience these inconveniences, which may also in
some measure be obviated by regularly placing a tight-fitting
cap, inlaid with cotton-wool, over the speculum at the conclusion
of work. This also protects the silver from the yellow
sulphurous deposit which soon collects upon it if used in a
town. All sudden variations of temperature act prejudicially
on the performance of specula, and their best work is only
accomplished when free from such disturbing elements. I
have rarely found the flat to become dewed in a natural
way during the progress of observation. If on a cold
night the observer puts his hand upon its supports in order
to alter its adjustment it instantly becomes dewed, or if
he stands looking down the tube it is almost sure to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
similarly affected; but in the ordinary course of work the
flat is little liable to become dewed in sensible degree.
With refractors dew-caps are very necessary, though they
do not always prevent the deposition of moisture on the
object-glass, and this occasions frequent wiping or drying,
which in either case is very objectionable.</p>

<p><i>Celestial Globe.</i>—This forms another extremely useful addendum
to the appliances of the amateur. It enables a great many
problems to be solved in a very simple manner, and helps the
young student to a lucid comprehension of the apparent
motions and positions of the fixed stars. With ‘Keith on
the Globes’ as a reference-book he may soon acquire the
method of determining the times of rising, southing, and
setting of any celestial object the place of which is known.
He can also readily find the height (altitude) and bearing
(azimuth) at any time. The distance in degrees between
any two stars or between a star and the Moon, a planet, or a
comet may be found at a glance by laying the quadrant of
altitude on the pair of objects and reading off the number of
degrees separating them. If a new comet has been discovered,
its position should be marked in pencil upon the
globe; and the observer, after having noted its exact place
relatively to neighbouring stars, may proceed to identify the
object with his telescope. If a large meteor is seen, its
apparent path amongst the constellations should be projected
on the globe and the points, in R.A. and Dec., of beginning
and ending of the flight read off and entered in a book. In
many other practical branches of astronomy this instrument
will prove highly serviceable, and is far preferable to a star-atlas.
But the latter is the most useful to the beginner who
is just learning the names of the stars and the configuration
of the chief groups, because on the globe the positions are all
reversed east and west. The surface of the globe represents
the entire star-sphere reduced to a common distance from the
earth, and as seen from outside that sphere. The observer,
therefore, must imagine his eye to be situated in the centre
of the globe, if he would see the stars in the same relative
places as he sees them in the heavens. The reversion of the
star-positions to which we have been alluding is very con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>fusing
at first, and no doubt it provokes mistakes, but a
little experience will practically remove this objection. The
one great recommendation to a star-atlas is that it displays
the stars in the natural positions in which they are discerned
by the eye, thus enabling the student to become readily
acquainted with them, whereas the celestial globe affords no
such facility. But in other respects the latter possesses some
valuable functions, and the amateur who devotes some of his
leisure to mastering the really useful problems will attain
a knowledge that will be of great benefit to him in after
years. A globe of 12-inches diameter will be large enough
for many purposes, but one of 18-inches will be the most
effective size. It should be mounted on a tall stand with
single body and tripod base. The stands, fitted with three
parallel legs, in which the globe is supported in the middle
by weak connections from them, are not nearly so durable.
I have used several 18-inch globes mounted in this manner,
and the supports have quite given way under the pressure of
constant use; but this is impossible with the strong single
body, which is capable of withstanding any strain. Globes are
frequently to be obtained second-hand, and at trifling cost;
but the observer must allow for precession if he uses an old
article. Many of the stars will be 1° or 2° east of the
positions in which they are marked on the globe; and it will
be necessary to remember this if the appliance is to be
employed for exact results.</p>

<p><i>Observatories.</i>—Massive and lofty buildings have long gone
out of fashion, and lighter, drier structures have properly
supplanted them. Instruments of size are generally placed
on or near the ground and solidly supported to ensure
stability, while the other erections are made consistent with
the necessity for pretty equable temperature and freedom from
damp. Amateurs will ordinarily find that a simple wooden
enclosure for the telescope, with suitable arrangements for
opening the top in any direction, is sufficient for their
purpose and very inexpensive. Some observers have, indeed,
secured the desired shelter for themselves and their
telescopes by means of a canvas tent provided with ready
means for obtaining sky-room. Berthon has given a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
description of an amateur’s observing-hut in ‘The English
Mechanic’ for October 13th and 20th, 1871; and Chambers
supplies some information about amateur observatories in
‘Nature’ for November 19th, 1885<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>. Mr. Thornthwaite’s.
‘Hints on Telescopes’ may be usefully consulted for details
of the Romsey Observatory, which, like the Berthon model,
seems peculiarly adapted to the necessities of the amateur.
The great requirements in such structures are that they should
be dry and not obstruct any region of the firmament. They
should also be large enough to allow the observer perfect
freedom in his movements and during the progress of his
observations. They are then decided advantages, and will
materially add to that comfort and convenience without
which it is rarely possible to accomplish really good work.
When an observatory is to be dispensed with it becomes
necessary to erect a small wooden house near the instrument,
especially if placed at the far end of a garden, in which the
observer may keep certain appliances, such as a lantern,
celestial globe, step-ladder or observing-seat, oil, &amp;c. Here
also he may record his seeings, complete his sketches, and
consult his working-list, star-charts, and ephemerides. A
shelter of this sort, apart from its practical helpfulness, avoids
any necessity for the observer to go in and out of doors,
up and down stairs, &amp;c., to the annoyance of the rest of his
family, who, on a frosty night, are decidedly not of an
astronomic turn, and vastly prefer house-warming to stargazing!</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—An observer in commencing work in any
department of astronomy will find it a very great assistance
to his progress if he carefully reads and digests all that has
been previously effected in the same line. He will see many
of the chief difficulties and their remedies explained. He will
further learn the best methods and be in the position of a man
who has already gained considerable experience. If he enter
upon a research of which he has acquired no foreknowledge
he will be merely groping in the dark, and must encounter
many obstacles which, though they may not effectually
turn him from his purpose, will at least involve a considerable
expenditure of time and labour. On the other hand, a
person who relies upon guidance from prior experimentalists
will probably make rapid headway. He will be fortified to
meet contingencies and to avoid complications as they arise.
He will be better enabled to discriminate as to the most
eligible means and will confidently endeavour to push them
to the furthest extent. By adopting existing instructions for
his direction and familiarizing himself with the latest information
from the best authorities he will in a great measure
ensure his own success or at least bring it within measurable]
distance. The want of this foreknowledge has often
been the main cause of failure, and it has sometimes led to
misconceptions and imaginary discoveries; for after much
thought and labour a man will overcome an impediment
or achieve an end in a way for which he claims credit, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
to find that he has been anticipated years before
and that had he consulted past records, his difficulties would have
been avoided and he might have pressed much nearer the
goal. Too much importance cannot be attached to the
acquisition of foreknowledge of the character referred to,
though we do not mean that former methods or results are
to be implicitly trusted. Let every observer judge for
himself to a certain extent and let him follow original plans
whenever he regards them as feasible; let him test preceding
results whenever he doubts their accuracy. We recommend
past experiences as a guide, not as an infallible precept. It
would be as much a mistake to follow the old groove with a
sort of credulous infatuation as it would be to enter upon it
in utter ignorance of theoretical knowledge. An observer
should take the direction of his labours from previous
workers, but be prepared to diverge from acknowledged rules
should he feel justified in doing so from his new experiences.</p>

<p><i>Working-Lists.</i>—Full advantage should be taken of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
good observing weather. Sir John Herschel most aptly said
that no time occupied in the preparation of working-lists is
ill-spent. In our climate the value of this maxim cannot
be overrated. If the 100 hours of exceptionally good
seeing, available in the course of the year, are to be profitably
employed, we must be continually prepared with a scheme of
systematic work. The observer should compile lists of objects
it is intended to examine, and their places must be marked
upon the globe or chart so as to avoid all troublesome references
during the actual progress of observation. If he has
to consult ephemerides and otherwise withdraw attention
from the telescope he loses valuable time: moreover the
positions hurriedly assigned in such cases are frequently
wrong and entail duplicate references, involving additional
waste of time; all this may be avoided by careful preparation
beforehand. If he has a series of double or variable stars
to observe he must tabulate their places in convenient order
so as to facilitate the work. If he intend hunting up nebulæ
or telescopic comets he must carefully mark their positions
relatively to adjoining stars. In the case of selenographical
objects or planetary markings he may equally prepare himself
by previous study. Adopting these precautions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
objects may be readily identified and the work expedited.
When no such preparation is made much confusion and loss
of time result. On a cloudy, wet day observers often consider
it unnecessary to make such provision and they are taken
at a great disadvantage when the sky suddenly clears. A
good observer, like a good general, ought to provide, by the
proper disposition of his means, against any emergency. In
stormy weather valuable observations are often permissible
if the observer is prompt, for the definition is occasionally
suitable under such circumstances. The most tantalizing
weather of all is that experienced during an anti-cyclone in
winter. For a week or two the barometer is very steady at
a high reading, the air is calm, and the sky is obscured with
an impenetrable mass of clouds.</p>

<p><i>Wind.</i>—The influence of wind on definition has been much
discussed in its various aspects, but it is scarcely feasible to
lay down definite rules on the subject. The east wind is
rarely favourable to good seeing, but the law is far from
absolute. We must remember that several distinct currents
sometimes prevail, and the air strata at various elevations are
of different degrees of humidity and therefore exercise different
effects upon telescopic definition. A mere surface breeze
from the east may underlie an extensive and moist current
from the south-west, and telescopic definition may prove very
fair under the combination. Calm nights when there is a
little haze and fog, making the stars look somewhat dim,
frequently afford wonderfully good seeing. As a rule, when
the stars are sparkling and brilliant, the definition is bad;
planetary disks are unsteady and the details obliterated in
glare. But this is not always so. I have sometimes found
in windy weather after storms from the west quarter, when
the air has become very transparent, that exceptionally sharp
views may be obtained; but unfortunately they are not without
drawbacks, for the telescope vibrates violently with every
gust of wind and the images cannot be held long enough for
anything satisfactory to be seen. The tenuous patches of
white cirrous cloud which float at high altitudes will often
improve definition in a surprising manner, especially on the
Moon and planets. Of course this does not apply to nebulæ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
or comets, which are objects of totally different character and
essentially require a <em>dark</em> night rather than good definition
before they may be seen under the best conditions. As a
rule, a steady, humid atmosphere is highly conducive to good
seeing, and it is rather improved than impaired by a little
fog or thin, white cloud. Some unique effects of peculiar
definition, such as oval or triangular star disks, have been
occasionally recorded, but we must content ourselves with a
bare reference to these phenomena. With regard to the
general question it may, however, be added that the character
of the seeing often varies at very short intervals in this
climate. In the course of a night’s work the definition will
sometimes fluctuate in a most remarkable manner. An
observer who comes to the telescope and finds it impossible
to obtain satisfactory images should not entirely relinquish
work at the first trial. After an interval he should again
test its performance, for it frequently happens that a night
ushered in by turbulent vapours, improves greatly at a later
period, and in the morning part becomes so fine that it is
worthy to be included in the select 100 hours assigned by
Sir W. Herschel as the annual limit. Those who reside in
towns will usually get the best definition after midnight,
because there is less interference then from smoke and heated
vapours. It would greatly conduce to our knowledge of
atmospheric vagaries as affecting definition, if observers,
especially those employing large aperture, preserved records
as to the quality of the seeing, also direction of wind and
readings of the barometer and thermometer.</p>

<p><i>Vision.</i>—There are perhaps differences quite as considerable
in powers of vision as in quality of definition. It is not meant
by this that the same person is subject to great individual
variations, though some people are certainly liable to fluctuations,
according to state of health and other conditions.
Some eyes, as already stated, are less effective in defining
planetary markings than in detecting minute stars or faint
satellites of distant planets. Of course the natural capacity
is greatly enhanced by constant practice, for the human eye
has proved itself competent to attain a surprising degree of
excellence by habitual training. Frequent efforts, if not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
overpressed so as to unduly strain the optic nerves, are found
to intensify rather than weaken the powers of sight. Thus a
distinguishing trait among astronomers has been their keenness
of vision, which, in many cases, they have retained to
an advanced age. It is true Dr. Kitchiner said his “eye at
the age of forty-seven became as much impaired by the
extreme exertion it had been put to in the prosecution of
telescope trials, as an eye which has been employed only in
ordinary occupations usually is at sixty years of age!—to
cultivate a little acquaintance with the particular and comparative
powers of telescopes requires many extremely eye-teasing
experiments.” But the Doctor’s opinion is not generally
confirmed by other testimony, the fact being that the
eye is usually strengthened by special service of this character.
To unduly tax or press its powers must result in injury; but
it is well known that the capacities of our sight and other
senses are enhanced by their healthy exercise, and that comparative
disuse is a great source of declining efficiency.
Before the observer may hope to excel as a telescopist it is
clear that a certain degree of training is requisite. Many
men exhibit very keen sight under ordinary circumstances,
but when they come to the telescope are hopelessly beaten
by a man who has a practised eye. On several occasions the
writer was much impressed with evidences of extraordinary
sight in certain individuals, but upon being tested at the
telescope they were found very deficient, both as regards
planetary detail and faint satellites. Objects which were
quite conspicuous to an experienced eye were totally invisible
to them. I believe it is a good plan for habitual observers
to employ method in exercising their sight. In my own case
I invariably use the right eye on the markings of planets
and the left on minute stars and satellites. Practice has
given each eye a superiority over the other in the special
work to which it has been devoted, and I fancy the practice
might be more generally followed with success.</p>

<p>It is an advantage to keep both eyes open when in the
act of observing, especially when surrounding objects are
perfectly dark and there is no distracting light from neighbouring
windows or lamps. The slight effort required to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
keep the disengaged eye closed interferes with the action of
the other, and though this is but trivial, critical work is not
efficiently performed under such conditions. Whenever light
interferes the observer may exclude it by a shade so arranged
as to afford complete protection to the unoccupied eye.</p>

<p>If faint objects are to be examined the observer should
remain in a dark situation for some little time previously, so
that the pupil of the eye may be dilated to the utmost extent
and in a state most suitable for such work. After coming
from a brilliantly lit apartment, or after viewing the Moon or
a conspicuous planet, the eye is totally unfit to receive impressions
from a difficult object, such as a minute star or faint
nebula or comet; some time must be allowed to elapse so
that the eye may recover its sensitiveness. As a rule amateurs
will find it best to confine their attention to one class of
objects only on the same evening, for if the Moon is first
examined and then immediately afterwards the telescope is
directed upon double stars and nebulæ, the latter objects are
little likely to be seen with good effect. If faint objects
generally are persistently studied night after night and the
observer refrains from solar and lunar work, his eye will
acquire greater sensitiveness and he will readily pick up
minute forms which are utterly beyond the reach of a man
who indiscriminately employs his eye and telescope upon
bright and faint objects.</p>

<p><i>Records.</i>—With regard to records, every observer should
make a note of what he sees, and at the earliest possible
instant after the observation has been effected. If the duty
is relegated to a subsequent occasion it is either not done
at all or done very imperfectly. The most salient features
of whatever is observed should be jotted down in systematic
form, so as to permit of ready reference afterwards. It is
useful to preserve these records in a paged book, with an
index, so that the matter can be regularly posted up. The
negligence of certain observers in this respect has resulted in
the total loss of valuable observations. Even if the details
appear to possess no significance, they should be faithfully
registered in a convenient, legible form, because many facts
deemed of no moment at the time may become of considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
importance. The observer should never refrain from such
descriptions because he attributes little value to them. Some
men keep voluminous diaries in which there is scarcely
anything worth record; but this is going to the other
extreme. All that is wanted is a concise and brief statement
of facts. Some persons have omitted references to features
or objects observed because they could not understand them,
and rather distrusted the evidence of their eyes; but these
are the very experiences which require careful record and
reinvestigation.</p>

<p><i>Drawing.</i>—Few observers are good draughtsmen; but it
is astonishing how seldom we meet with real endeavours
to excel in this respect. Every amateur should practise
drawing, however indifferent his efforts may be. Delineations,
even if roughly executed, are often more effective than
whole pages of description. Pictorial representations form
the leading attraction of astronomical literature, and are
capable of rendering it more interesting to the popular mind
than any other influence. They induce a more apt conception
of what celestial objects are really like than any
amount of verbal matter can possibly do. For this reason
it becomes the obvious duty of every observer to cultivate
sketching and drawing, at least in a rudimentary way. He
will frequently find it essential to illustrate his descriptions,
so as to ensure their ready comprehension. In fact, a
thoroughly efficient observer must of necessity become a
draughtsman. It should, however, be his invariable aim
to depict just what he sees and in precisely the form in which
it impresses his eye. Mere pictorial embellishments must be
disregarded, and he should be careful not to include doubtful
features, possibly existing in the imagination alone, unless he
intends them simply for his own guidance in future investigations.
If he sees but little, and it is faithfully delineated,
it will be of more real value than a most elaborate drawing
in which the eye and imagination have each played a part.
It is an undoubted fact that some of the most striking illustrations
in astronomical handbooks are disfigured by features
either wrongly depicted or having no existence whatever.
There is very great need for caution in representing such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
markings only as are distinctly and unmistakably visible.
In all cases where the object is new or doubtful the observer
should await duplicate observations before announcing it. It
is better that new features should evade discovery than that
delusive representations should be handed down to posterity.
As regards selenographical drawings I would refer the reader
to what Mr. Eiger advises on p. 21 and 22 of volume v. of the
‘Journal of the Liverpool Astronomical Society.’ My own
plan in sketching at the telescope is to first roughly delineate
the features bit by bit as I successively glimpse them, assuring
myself, as I proceed, as to general correctness in outline and
position; then, on completion, I go indoors to a better light
and make copies while the details are still freshly impressed
on the mind. To soften details a small piece of blotting-paper
must be wrapped round the pointed end of the pencil,
and the parts requiring to be smoothed gently touched or
rubbed until the desired effect is attained. This simple
method, properly applied, will enable delicate markings to be
faithfully reproduced, and it certainly adds in no small degree
to the merit of a drawing.</p>

<p><i>Friendly Indulgences.</i>—Every man whose astronomical predilections
are known, and who has a telescope of any size, is
pestered with applications from friends and others who wish
to view some of the wonders of the heavens. Of course it is
the duty of all of us to encourage a laudable interest in the
science, especially when evinced by neighbours or acquaintances;
but the utility of an observer constituting himself a
showman, and sacrificing many valuable hours which might
be spent in useful observations, may be seriously questioned.
The weather is so bad in this country that we can ill spare an
hour from our scanty store. Is it therefore desirable to
satisfy the idle curiosity of people who have no deep-seated
regard for astronomy, and will certainly never exhibit their
professed interest in a substantial manner? Assuredly not.
The time of our observers is altogether too valuable to be
employed in this fashion. Yet it is an undisputed fact
that some self-denying amateurs are unwearying in their
efforts to accommodate their friends in the respect alluded to.
My own impression is that, except in special cases, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
observer will best consult the interests of astronomy, as well
as his own convenience and pleasure, by declining the character
of showman; for depend upon it a person who appreciates
the science in the right fashion will find ways and
means to procure a telescope and gratify his tastes to the
fullest capacity. Some years ago I took considerable trouble
on several evenings in showing a variety of objects to a
clerical friend, who expressed an intention to buy a telescope
and devote his leisure to the science. I spent many hours in
explanations &amp;c.; but some weeks later my pupil informed
me his expenses were so heavy that he really could not afford
to purchase instruments. Yet I found soon after that he
afforded £30 in a useless embellishment of the front of his
residence, and it so disgusted me that I resolved to waste no
more precious time in a similar way.</p>

<p><i>Open-Air Observing.</i>—Night air is generally thought to be
pernicious to health; but the longevity of astronomers is
certainly opposed to this idea. Those observers who are
unusually susceptible to affections of the respiratory organs
must of course exercise extreme care, and will hardly be
wise in pursuing astronomical work out of doors on keen,
wintry nights. But others, less liable to climatic influences,
may conduct operations with impunity and safety during the
most severe weather. Precautions should always be taken to
maintain a convenient degree of warmth; and, for the rest,
the observer’s enthusiasm must sustain him. A “wadded
dressing-gown” has been mentioned as an effective protection
from cold. I have found that a long, thick overcoat,
substantially lined with flannel, and under this a stout
cardigan jacket, will resist the inroads of cold for a long
time. On very trying nights a rug may also be thrown over
the shoulders and strapped round the body. During intense
frosts, however, the cold will penetrate (as I have found while
engaged in prolonged watches for shooting-stars) through
almost any covering. As soon as the observer becomes
uncomfortably chilly he should go indoors and thoroughly
warm his things before a fire. He may then return fortified
to his work and pursue it for another period before the frost
again makes its presence disagreeably felt. On windy nights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
a knitted woollen helmet to cover the head, and reaching to
the shoulders, is an excellent protection; but an observer had
better not wear it more often than is imperative, or it
becomes a necessity on ordinary nights. It is a great
mistake to suppose that “a glass of something hot” before
going into the night air is a good preventive to catching
cold. It acts rather in the contrary way. The reaction after
the system has been unduly heated only renders the observer
more sensitive, and the inhalation of cold air is then very
liable to induce affections of the throat.</p>

<p>A telescope permanently erected in the open, and exposed
to all weathers, must soon lose its smart and bright appearance,
but it need lose none of its efficiency, which is of far more
importance; for it is intended for service, not for show.
The instrument should be kept well painted and oiled. I
find vaseline an excellent application for the screws and
parts controlling the motions, as it is not congelative like
common oils. The observer, before a night’s work and
before darkness sets in, will do well to examine his instrument
and see that it is in the best condition to facilitate
work. Whole tribes of insects take up their habitation in
the base or framework, and even in the telescope itself if
they can effect a lodgment; and I have sometimes had to
sweep away a perfect labyrinth of spiders’ webs from the
interior of the main tube. On one occasion I could not see
anything through the finder, try how I would. I afterwards
discovered that a mason-wasp (<i>Odynerus murarius</i>) had adopted
the vacuity in front of the eye-lens as a suitable site for her
nest; and here she had formed her cells, deposited her eggs,
and enclosed the caterpillars necessary for the support of the
young when hatched. On another night I came hurriedly to
the telescope to observe Jupiter with my single-lens eyepiece,
power 252, but could make nothing out of it but a confused
glare, subject to sudden extinctions and other extraordinary
vagaries. I supposed that the branches of a tree, waving
in the wind, must be interposed in the line of sight, but soon
saw this could not possibly be the explanation. Looking
again into the eyepiece, I caught a momentary glimpse of
what I interpreted for the legs of an insect magnified into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
gigantic proportions and very distinct on the bright background
formed by Jupiter much out of focus. On detaching
the eyepiece and carrying it indoors to a light, an innocent-looking
sample of the common earwig crawled out of it.
The gyrations of the insect in its endeavours to find a place
of egress from its confinement had clearly caused the effects
alluded to. Telescopic observers are thus liable to become
microscopic observers before they are conscious of the fact,
and perhaps also in opposition to their intention. Other
experiences might be narrated, especially as regards nocturnal
observing in country or suburban districts, where
the “serious student of the skies” may, like myself, find
diversion to his protracted vigils by the occasional capture
of a too-inquisitive hedgehog or some other marauding
quadruped.</p>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Nearly all the most successful observers have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
been men of method. The work they took in hand has
been followed persistently and with certain definite ends
in view. They recognized that there should be a purpose
in every observation. Some amateurs take an incredible
amount of pains to look up an object for the simple satisfaction
of seeing it. But seeing an object is not observing
it. The mere view counts for nothing from a scientific
standpoint, though it may doubtless afford some satisfaction
to the person obtaining it. A practical astronomer, with
his own credit at stake and the interests of the science
at heart, will require something more. In observing a
comet he will either fix its position by careful measurement
with reference to stars near, or critically examine its
physical peculiarities, or perhaps both. In securing these
data he will have accomplished useful work, which may
quite possibly have an enduring value. In other branches
of observation his aim will be similar, namely to acquire
new materials with regard to place or to physical phenomena,
according to the nature of the research upon which
he happens to be engaged. Such results as he gathers are
neatly tabulated in a form convenient for after comparisons.
There have been instances, we know, where sheer carelessness
has resulted in the loss of important discoveries. Lalande<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
must have found Neptune (and mathematical astronomy
would have been robbed of its greatest triumph) half a
century before it was identified in Galle’s telescope, but
his want of care enabled it to elude him just when he was
hovering on the very verge of its discovery. Numerous
other instances might be mentioned. Failure may either
arise from imperfect or inaccurate records, from a want of
discrimination, from neglect in tracing an apparent discordance
to its true source, or from hesitation. I may be
pardoned for mentioning a case within my own experience.
On July 11, 1881, just before daylight, I stood contemplating
Auriga, and the idea occurred to me to sweep the
region with my comet eyepiece, but I hesitated, thinking
the prospect not sufficiently inviting. Three nights later
Schæberle at Ann Arbor, U.S.A., discovered a bright telescopic
comet in Auriga! Before sunrise on October 4 of
the same year I had been observing Jupiter, and again
hesitated as to the utility of comet-seeking, but, remembering
the little episode in my past experience, I instantly
set to work, and at almost the first sweep alighted upon
a suspicious object which afterwards proved itself a comet
of short period. These facts teach one to value his opportunities.
They cannot be lightly neglected, coming as they do
all too rarely. The observer should never hesitate. He must
endeavour to at least effect a little whenever an occasion offers;
for it is just that little which may yield a marked success—greater,
perhaps, than months of arduous labour may achieve
at another time.</p>

<p><i>Perseverance.</i>—Persistency in observation, apart from the
value derived from cumulative results, increases the powers
of an observer to a considerable degree. This is especially
the case when the same objects are subjected to repeated
scrutiny. A first view, though it may seem perfectly satisfactory
in its conditions and results, does not represent what
the observer is capable of doing with renewed effort. Let
us suppose that a lunar object with complicated detail is to
be thoroughly surveyed. The observer delineates at the first
view everything that appears to be visible. But a subsequent
effort reveals other features which eluded him before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
and many additional details are gradually reached during
later observations. Ultimately the observer finds that his
first drawing is scarcely more than a mere outline of the
formation as he sees it at his latest efforts. Details which
he regarded as difficult at first have become comparatively
conspicuous, and a number of delicate structures have been
exhibited which were quite beyond his reach at the outset.
The eye has become familiarized with the object, and its
powers fairly brought out by training and experience. This
training is very serviceable, but is seldom appreciated in the
degree of its influence. Many a tyro has abandoned a projected
series of observations on finding that his initiatory
view falls wofully short of published drawings or descriptions.
He considers himself hopelessly distanced, and regards
it as impossible to attain—much less excel—the results
achieved by his predecessors. He does not realize that their
work is the issue of years of close application, and that it
represents the collective outcome of many successive nights.
I need hardly say that it is a great mistake to anticipate
failure in this way. No telescopic work has been done in the
past that will not be done better in the future. No observer
can rate his capacity until he has rigorously tested it by
experience. The eye must become accustomed to an object
before it is able to do itself justice. Those who have been
sedulously engaged in a certain research will, as a rule, see
far more than others who are but just entering upon it—not
from a natural superiority of vision, but because of the aptitude
and power acquired by practice. No matter how meagre an
observer’s primary attempts may be, he should by no means
relax his efforts, but rather feel that his want of success
must be remedied by experience. It is a common fault with
observers that they leave too much to their instruments, and
rely upon them for the results which really depend entirely
upon their personal endeavours. A skilled workman will do
good work with indifferent tools; for after all it is the
character of the man that is evident in his results, and not so
much the resources which art places in his hands.</p>

<p>Much also depends upon the feelings by which the amateur
is actuated when he commences work. A few enter into it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
with a degree of energy and determination that knows no
wearying and will accept no defeat. Others display a half-hearted
enthusiasm, and are constantly doubting either their
personal ability or their instrumental means. Many others,
again, when the circumstances appear a little against them
regard failure as inevitable. It need hardly be said, however,
that every difficulty may be surmounted by perseverance,
and that a man’s enthusiasm is often the measure of
his success, and success is rarely denied to him whose heart is
in his work.</p>

<p><i>Definition in Towns.</i>—The astronomical journals contain
some interesting references to the definition of telescopes in
large towns. Of course the purer the air the better for observational
purposes. But observers who reside in populous
districts need not despair of doing really useful work. The
vapours hanging over a large city are by no means so objectional
as is commonly supposed. When they are circulating
rapidly across the observer’s field of view they will prove very
troublesome at times; but in a comparatively tranquil state
of the air definition is excellent. I have frequently found
planetary markings very sharp and steady through the smoke
and fog of Bristol. The interposing vapours have the effect
of moderating the bright images and improving their quality.
When there is a driving wind, and these heated vapours from
the city are rolling rapidly past, objects at once appear in a
state of ebullition, and the work of observation may as well
be postponed. Smoke from neighbouring chimneys is utterly
ruinous to definition: a bright star is transformed into a
seething, cometary mass, and the planets undergo contortions
of the most astonishing character. Large instruments being
more susceptible to such influences—and, indeed, to atmospherical
vagaries of all kinds—are chiefly affected by the
drawbacks we have alluded to; but there are many opportunities
when their powers may be fully utilized. In sweeping
for faint comets, or in other work (such as the observation of
nebulæ) where a dark sky is the first essential, a town station
has a manifest disadvantage because of the artificial illumination
of the atmosphere. But for general telescopic
work the conditions do not offer a serious impediment, espe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>cially
if the observer is careful to seize the many suitable
occasions that must occur. The direction of the wind relatively
to his position and the central part of the city, will
occasion considerable differences to an observer who uses a
telescope in a suburban locality.</p>

<p><i>Photography.</i>—Upon this branch of practical astronomy
not much will be said in this volume, as it is rather beyond
its scope, and possibly also beyond the resources of ordinary
amateurs, so far as really valuable work is concerned. A
reference must, however, be made to an innovation which has
deservedly assumed a very prominent place, and is clearly
destined to exert an accelerating influence on the progress of
<em>exact</em> astronomy. At present it is impossible to foretell how
far it may be employed and extended, but judging from recent
developments its applications will be as manifold as they will
be valuable. Photographic records possess a great advantage
over others, because they are more accurate and therefore
more reliable. They are pictures from Nature taken by
means free from the bias and error inseparable from mere
eye-estimations or hand-drawings. The latter are full of
discordances when compared one with another, and can
seldom be implicitly trusted; but in the photograph a
different state of things prevails. Here we have a faithful
portrayal or reproduction of the object impressed by itself
upon the plate. Hence it can be depended upon, because
there has been no intermediate meddling either with its
position or features by what may be termed artistic misrepresentation.
True, there may be imperfections in the
process; trifling flaws and obstructions will invariably creep
in wherever comparatively new and novel work is attempted,
but these will but little detract from the value of its results.
Photography is obviously a means of discovery as well as a
means of accurate record; for nebulæ and faint stars quite
invisible to the eye have been distinguished for the first time
upon the negatives. Those of our amateurs who intend
working in this branch will find it a productive one, and
not decaying in interest; but the necessary outfit will be
expensive if thoroughly capable instruments are to be
employed in the service.</p>

<p><i>Publications.</i>—The observer of to-day may esteem himself
particularly fortunate in regard to the number and quality of
the astronomical journals within his reach. Discoveries
and current events receive prompt notice in these, and
readers are fully informed upon the leading topics. Among
the best of the periodicals alluded to are ‘The Observatory’
(Taylor &amp; Francis, London), ‘The Sidereal Messenger’
(Northfield, Minn., U.S.A.), and <i lang="fr">L’Astronomie</i> (Gautier-Villars,
Paris). The <i lang="de">Astronomische Nachrichten</i> (Kiel, Germany)
is a very old and valued serial, and ‘The Astronomical
Journal’ (Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A.) may also be favourably
mentioned. The ‘Monthly Notices’ of the Royal Astronomical
Society and the ‘Journals’ of the Liverpool and
British Astronomical Societies contain many interesting
materials. ‘Nature,’ ‘The English Mechanic,’ and ‘Knowledge’
are among the English journals which devote part of
their space to the science; and the beautiful illustrations
in the latter entitle it to special recognition. It is evident,
from this short summary, the amateur will find that his
literary appetite may be amply satisfied, and should he desire
a channel for recording his own work or ideas the publications
referred to offer him every facility and encouragement.</p>

<p>As to almanacks, the ‘Nautical’ which has been termed
“The Astronomer’s Bible,” includes a mass of tabular matter,
some portion of which is of utility to the amateur, but it does
not give data which are to be found in some other publications.
I refer particularly to ephemerides of the satellites of Mars,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, to the dates of max. and min.
of variable stars, to the times of rising and setting of the
Sun, Moon, and planets, to the epochs and positions of
meteor-showers, &amp;c. The annual ‘Companion to the Observatory’
furnishes most of these details, and ‘Whitaker’s
Almanack’ and Brown &amp; Sons’ ‘Nautical Almanack’ each
contain a large amount of serviceable information. The
latter, however, is chiefly devoted to topics connected with
Navigation, while ‘Whitaker’s Almanack’ is an extensive
repertory of general facts.</p>

<p>With respect to handbooks much depends upon the direction
of the observer’s labours, for he will obviously require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
works dealing expressly with his special subject. As a
reliable companion to the telescope, Webb’s ‘Celestial Objects
for Common Telescopes’ (4th edit., 1881) is indispensable;
as a work of reference, and one forming an exhaustive conspectus
of astronomical facts, Chambers’s ‘Descriptive Astronomy’
(4th edit., in 3 vols., 1889) may be recommended.
Ledger’s ‘The Sun, its planets and their satellites’ is another
good descriptive work. The beginner will find Noble’s
‘Hours with a 3-inch Telescope’ full of very instructive and
agreeable material; while the more experienced astronomer,
requiring a masterly exposition of the principles of the
science, must procure Sir J. Herschel’s ‘Outlines’ (11th edit.,
1871). In departmental work books of more exclusive character
will be necessary. Thus, students of solar physics will
want Young’s volume on ‘The Sun;’ observers of our satellite
will need Neison’s ‘Moon.’ Those who find double stars
interesting should get Crossley, Gledhill, &amp; Wilson’s ‘Handbook’
and Chambers’s revised edition of Admiral Smyth’s
‘Cycle;’ others working on variable stars will need the
Catalogues of Chandler and Gore. Jovian phenomena are well
represented in Stanley Williams’s ‘Zenographic Fragments.’
Comets have been fully treated of in works by Cooper, Hind,
and Guillemin; while to the observer of eclipses Johnson’s
‘Eclipses Past and Future’ is a valuable guide. Everyone
interested in nebulæ will of course require Herschel-Dreyer’s
‘General Catalogue,’ containing 7840 objects and published
by the Royal Astronomical Society in 1888. As to planetary
observations, the several works of Webb, Chambers (vol. i.),
and Ledger, first cited, supply a large amount of detail,
almost obviating the necessity for further books.</p>

<p><i>Past and Future.</i>—Observers and telescopes go on increasing
day by day, and the future of astronomy has a most brilliant
outlook. Photography has latterly effected a partial revolution
in observation, though it can never entirely supersede old
methods. Spectrum analysis, too, has formed a valuable
acquisition during the last quarter of a century. With the
new and refined processes, and with the gigantic instruments
which have been erected, we may confidently anticipate many
additions to our knowledge, especially in regard to very small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
and faint bodies which the inferior appliances of previous
years have failed to grasp. And it is certain that some of the
presumed discoveries of past times must be expunged, because
not verified by the more perfect and powerful researches of a
later date. Let us place in parallel columns (1) a few of the
suspected objects thus to be erased, and (2) some of those
which the future will probably add to our store:-–</p>

<p>Whatever may be the direction of future enquiries or the
departures from old and tried methods, ordinary amateurs
with small instruments, though handicapped more heavily
as regards the prospect of effecting discoveries, may yet
always be expected to accomplish useful work. Even to him
who simply makes the science a hobby and a source of
recreation in a leisure hour after the cares of business, the
sky never ceases to afford a means of agreeable entertainment.
He may neither achieve distinction nor seek it; but this he
will assuredly do—gain an instructive insight into the marvellous
works of his Creator, and acquire a knowledge which
can only exercise an elevating tone to his life. The observer
who quietly, from his cottage window, surveys the evening
star or the new Moon through his little telescope often finds
a deeper pleasure than the proficient astronomer who, from
his elevated and richly appointed observatory, discovers new
orbs with one of the most powerful instruments ever made.</p>

<p><i>Attractions of Telescopic Work.</i>—In concluding our comments
we may briefly refer to the importance and pleasure
attached to telescopic work, and the growing popularity of
observation in the attractive and diverse field of astronomy.
A telescope may either be employed as an instrument of
scientific discovery and critical work, or it may be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
a source of recreation and instruction. By its means the
powers of the eye are so far assisted and expanded that we
are enabled to form a clearer conception of the wonderful
works of the Creator than could be obtained in any other
way. Objects which appear to natural vision in dim and
uncertain characters are resolved, even in telescopes of the
smallest pretentions, into pictures of well-defined outlines
containing details of configuration far exceeding what are
expected. And it is entirely owing to the exact measurements
obtained under telescopic power that many of the most
important problems of astronomy have been satisfactorily
solved. To this instrument we are indebted, not only in a
great measure for our knowledge of the physical features
of many celestial bodies, but also for the accurate information
we have gained as to their motions, distances, and magnitudes.
Apart from this it is capable of affording ample
entertainment to all those who are desirous of viewing for
themselves some of the absorbing wonders of astronomy as
described in our handbooks. And a demonstration of this
practical kind is more effective than any amount of description
in bringing home to the comprehension of the uninitiated
the unique and picturesque side of astronomy.</p>

<p>The Sun is not an object comprehended in the title of this
volume. But to have omitted reference to a body of such
vast importance, and one displaying so many interesting
features to the telescopic observer, would have been inexcusable.
We may regard the Sun as the dominant power,
the controlling orb, and the great central luminary of our
system. The phenomena visibly displayed on his surface
assume a particular significance, as affecting a body occupying
so high a place in the celestial mechanism.</p>

<p>The mean apparent diameter of the Sun is 32′ 3″·6, and
his real diameter 866,000 miles. The apparent diameter
varies from a minimum of 31′ 32″ at the end of June to a
maximum of 32′36″; at the end of December; and the mean
value is reached both at the end of March and September.
The Sun’s mean distance from the Earth is about 92,900,000
miles, computed from a solar parallax of 8″·8, which appears
to agree with the best of recent determinations. At this
distance the linear value of 1″ of arc is 447 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>The Sun’s apparent diameter is as follows on the first day
of each month:—</p>

<p>Solar observations may be pursued with a facility greater
than that attending work in some other departments of
practical astronomy. The Moon, planets, and stars have to
be observed at night, when cold air, darkness, and other circumstances
are the cause of inconvenience; but the student
of the Sun labours only in the light and warmth of genial
days, when all the incidentals to observation may be agreeably
performed. There are, however, some drawbacks even
in this pleasant sphere of work. The light of the Sun is
so great that much persistent observation is apt to have
an injurious effect on the eye, and will certainly deaden its
sensitiveness on faint objects. In the summer months the
observer experiences discomfort during a lengthy observation
from remaining so long in the powerful rays of the Sun, some
of which must fall upon his face unless measures are adopted
to shield it. During the progress of solar work the student
should always provide for himself as much shelter as possible
from the glare, which must otherwise disturb that equanimity
of feeling in the absence of which no delicate research is
likely to be successfully conducted.</p>

<p>“Spots on the Sun” were remarked long before the telescope
came into service. In the early Chinese annals many
references are made to these objects; thus, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 188,
February 14, it is recorded—“The colour of the Sun reddish-yellow;
a fleckle in the Sun (bird-shaped).” Other ancient
notices compare the spots to a flying bird, an apple, or an
egg. Many spots were seen in later years, especially in 321,
807, 840, 1096, &amp;c. In 807 a large black spot upon the Sun
was watched during a period of eight days. It reflects much
credit upon observers of a past age that they performed so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
many useful feats of observation, though relying simply upon
the powers with which Nature alone had endowed them.
They anticipated the telescope in some important discoveries.
Large sun-spots are not, it is true, difficult features to
perceive with the naked eye under certain circumstances;
for whenever there is a fog or haze sufficiently dense to veil
the lustre of the Sun in suitable degree, they can be readily
seen, presuming, of course, that such spots are in existence at
the time. They are sometimes observed, in a purely casual
way, by people who may happen to glance at the Sun when
he is involved in fog and looks like a dull, red ball suspended
in the firmament. On one occasion, near sunset, in the
autumn of 1870, I saw four large spots on different parts of
the Sun, and these phenomena were very numerous at about
this time. When spots attain a diameter of 50″ or more
they may be detected by persons of good sight; but if the
Sun is high and clear, coloured glass must be used to defend
the eye.</p>

<p>Doubt hangs over the question as to the first telescopic
observer of the spots. It is certain that Fabricius, Galilei,
Harriot, and Scheiner all remarked them in about the year
1611; and of these Fabricius perhaps deserves the chief
praise, as the first who published a memoir on the subject.
Galilei appears undoubtedly to have had priority in recognizing
the bright spots, or <i lang ="la">faculæ</i>. Scheiner discovered that
the black spots, or <i lang ="la">maculæ</i>, are composed of a dark umbra and
a fainter outlying shade, called the penumbra. Arago quotes
him as having also described the Sun as “covered over its
whole surface with very small, bright, and obscure points, or
with lively and sombre streaks of very slender dimensions,
crossing each other in all directions.” He announced, too,
that the spots were confined to a narrow zone on the north
and south sides of the equator, and this he termed the “Royal
Zone.”</p>

<p>Some grave difficulties appear to have marked the attempts
of the earlier observers; for they did not all use coloured
glasses, and the dazzling light of the Sun, intensified by their
lenses, often overpowered the sight, and so we find them
awaiting opportunities when fog partly obscured the Sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
near his rising or setting. Thus Harriot, who seems to have
noticed and figured three sun-spots as early as 1610, Dec. 8,
says:—“The altitude of the Sonne being 7 or 8 degrees, and
it being a frost and a mist, I saw the Sonne in this manner.”
His drawing followed. On another occasion he says:—“A
notable mist: I observed the Sonne at sundry times, when it
was fit.” Fabricius advised other observers to commence
their observations by admitting only a small portion of the
Sun into the field, so that the eye might be prepared to
receive the light of the entire disk. Galilei was equally
unaware of the advantage of tinted glass, and adopted the
expedient of scanning the Sun when placed in the vicinity
of the horizon. He remarks that “the spot of 1612, April 5
appeared at sunset;” and his writings contain other references
of similar import. Scheiner, however, appears to
have been more alive to the requirements of the work, and
employed a plain green glass placed in front of the object-lens
of his telescope.</p>

<p>Under the various circumstances we have been alluding to,
the views obtained of the solar surface must necessarily have
been of a very defective character, and the old observers at
least deserve our sympathy in their exertions. No such
obstacles confront the observer now. He has everything
provided for him. Instrumental devices rob the Sun of his
noonday brilliancy, and the eye serenely scans the details of
his expansive image without the slightest pain or effort.</p>

<p>Small telescopes are peculiarly well adapted for solar observations.
A good 3-inch refractor or 4-inch reflector will
reveal an astonishing diversity of structure in the spots, and
show something of the complicated <i lang ="la">minutiæ</i> of the general
surface. If the aperture of either instrument is 2 inches
more than that stated, so much the better; but further than
this it is rarely advisable to go. When the objective or
mirror exceeds a diameter of 5 or 6 inches a stop often
improves the images, and even smaller instruments will
perform better when a little contracted. Definition is here
the point to be desired; of light we have a superabundance.
But if the observer meditates a critical analysis of the detail,
either of a single spot, of a group of spots, or of a small area<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
of the luminous surface, then a fair amount of aperture should
be used, because greater aperture means greater separating
power, and the latter will be useful in resolving the network
of fibrous materials of which apparently the whole surface is
composed. But for the common requirements of the observer
an instrument of 3 or 4 inches will be found very effective,
and it can either be used on a short tripod stand, placed on a
steady table near a window having a south aspect, or it may be
mounted on a tall garden stand and, according to the owner’s
pleasure, either fixed at his window or in his garden. Two
powers will be really necessary—one of about 60 and a field
of quite 33″ to contain the entire disk and give a good general
view, and another of 150 to which the observer will have
recourse when examining details. Additional eyepieces will
be sometimes useful, especially one of about 100; but the
power of 60 previously recommended will, if a Huygenian,
answer the same purpose, for if the field-lens is removed it
will be increased to about 90. And should the observer think
that anything is to be gained by a higher magnifier than 150,
let him use the eye-lens only of that power. I have obtained
many exquisite views of sun-spots with a single lens, and,
instead of purchasing new eyepieces, a real advantage will be
derived in adopting the plan suggested. There will be a
smaller field and more colour about the image, but the
improvement in definition is considerable, and more than
balances these disadvantages.</p>

<p>Tinted glass must always be employed, unless a dense fog
prevails, in which case the example of the old observers may
be emulated. Several coloured glasses, of various depths, are
needed for use according as the occasion requires. With a
high Sun on a bright June day a darker tint will be necessary
than in the winter, when the Sun’s rays are but feebly transmitted
through the horizontal vapours. Red glass is unsatisfactory,
as there is much heat and glare with it; but when
used in combination with green the effect is excellent. Green
alone is often used, and answers well; but it is not always
thick and dense enough for the purpose. The plan of Sir W.
Herschel, to interpose a glass trough of diluted ink, has never
become popular, though he found it to succeed admirably.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Smoked glass is also adapted for solar work, and recommends
itself as being always obtainable at a minute’s notice. Some
observers use a Barlow lens, with a thin film of silver deposited
on the surfaces. It is then sufficiently transparent to
give a neutral tint when held before a light, and sharp definition
is said to be obtained without additional protection.
Mr. Thornthwaite has also employed a coloured Barlow lens
with effect.</p>

<p>A solar diagonal is a very necessary appliance if the
observer would ensure perfect safety; for any refractor
exceeding 2-inches aperture may, when turned on the Sun,
focus enough heat to fracture the tinted sun-glass. The diagonal,
by preserving a part only of the solar rays which are
transmitted by the object-glass, enables observations to be
made in security. This little instrument is comparatively
cheap, and no telescope is complete without one. Dawes’s
solar eyepiece serves the same purpose in a different manner,
but it is an expensive luxury. In the latter construction
there is a perforated diaphragm fixed near the eyepiece and
so arranged that the quantity of admitted light may be
modified consistently with the observer’s wishes.</p>

<p>In reflecting-telescopes with glass mirrors, effective views
of the Sun are obtainable by employing unsilvered mirrors;
for sufficient light is reflected by the glass surfaces to form
good images of solar detail.</p>

<p>What, perhaps, interferes more than any other circumstance
with successful observation of the Sun, is the fact that
the rays, falling upon the telescope and objects near, induce a
good deal of radiation, the direct tendency of which is to
impair the definition and give a rippling effect to the disk.
This is sometimes present in such force that the spots are
subject to an incessant commotion, which serves to obliterate
their more delicate features. A shady place is best, therefore,
for such work; and if the observer leaves his telescope for a
short time, intending to resume observations, it should never
be placed broadside to the Sun, or the tube wall get hot, and
heated currents must be generated in the interior, to the ruin
of subsequent views.</p>

<p>A large sun-spot consists of an apparently black nucleus, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
brown umbra, divided possibly by veins of bright matter or
by encroachments of the penumbra which surrounds it. The
latter is of much lighter tone than the umbra, though often
similar in its general form. The outer edges of the umbra
are serrated or scalloped by rice-grain protuberances. The
inner region of the penumbra is much brighter than the
outer, and the latter often exhibits quite a dusky fringe,
induced by lines of dark material intervening with the
brighter particles. The filaments forming the penumbra—often
grouped in a radial manner with reference to the centre
of a spot—would appear to be more widely separated near the
outer border of the penumbra, and sufficiently so to allow sections
of the umbral layer of the Sun to be observed through
the interstices. The lighter tint of the interior part of the
penumbra is stated to be due to contrast; but this is a
mistake. The difference is too definite and distinct to permit
such an explanation. Mr. Maunder says “that usually (not
invariably) the penumbra darkens towards the umbra, and
that the phenomenon as ordinarily described is merely an
effect of contrast.” My own observations, however, appear
to show that there is an actual difference of detail in the
outer and inner portions of the penumbra, which gives a
darker tone to the former.</p>

<p>In drawing the forms of sun-spots the observer must be
expeditious, because of the variations which are quickly and
constantly affecting them. In concluding a sketch I find it
essential to make several alterations in it, owing to the
changes which have occurred in the spots during the interval
of a quarter of an hour or so since it was commenced. The
details must be filled in consecutively, each one being the
result of a careful scrutiny. When finished, the whole sketch
should be compared with the object itself and amended if found
necessary. The observer should also mark upon the sheet the
measured or estimated latitude and longitude of the spot, and
make a finished drawing from the basis of his sketch as soon
as possible afterwards. At Stonyhurst Observatory excellent
delineations of solar phenomena are made; and the late
Father Perry, who lost his life in the cause of science, thus
described the method:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>—“On every fine day the image of the
Sun is projected on a thin board attached to the telescope, and
a drawing of the Sun is made, 10½ inches in diameter, showing
the position and outline of the spots visible. It is the first
duty of the assistant who makes the drawings to note the
position of the spots, and sketch their outlines. He then
proceeds to shade in the penumbra and to draw the finer
details, comparing the drawing from time to time by placing
it alongside the projected image of the spots. The position of
the faculæ is then filled in with a red pencil, so that the eye
can at once recognize their grouping with respect to sun-spots,
and the other details drawn with a black pencil.” The
same astronomer also stated that, “as a general rule, careful
drawings of the projected image of the Sun give much more
satisfactory pictures of the solar surface than the photographs
taken even at our best observatories. It is quite true that
occasionally an exquisite photograph on an enlarged scale may
be obtained, which exhibits features such as no pencil could
portray as accurately, but rarely indeed will the photograph
furnish all the details that a practised eye and hand,
kept patiently at the sketch-board, will detect and faithfully
describe. And the reason is not far to seek; for any experienced
observer knows that, even on the finest day, the definition
is continually changing with the sky, and that it is only
at comparatively rare moments we can expect those perfect
conditions that enable the finest details to stand out sharply,
as Schiaparelli expresses it, like the faintest lines of a steel
engraving. A photograph may be accidentally taken during
one of these exceptionally favoured moments; but a patient
draughtsman is almost sure to secure several of these best
opportunities at each prolonged visit to his sketch-board.
What would, therefore, be a great acquisition at present is a
series of careful solar drawings, taken at short intervals of
time, on days when characteristic spots are visible upon the
Sun; and this would be the surest way of adding much
valuable information to that already possessed concerning the
changes that take place in the solar photosphere.”</p>

<p>With regard to ascertaining the dimensions of sun-spots,
very precise results require accurate means of measurement
and some mathematical knowledge. For the general purposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
of the amateur, who will only want round numbers, simple
methods may be adopted with success. I have used, on a
4-inch refractor, a graduated piece of plane glass, mounted
suitably for insertion in the focus of the eyepiece, and marked
with divisions 1/200 of an inch apart. With power 65 I find
the Sun’s disk at max. distance covers 83 divisions of the graduated
lens; so that one division = 22″·8, the Sun’s min.
diameter being 1892″. Each division, therefore, is equal to
10,434 miles, the Sun’s real diameter being 866,000 miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_20"></a>Fig. 20.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(19).jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Sun-spot of June 19, 1889, 2<sup>h</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span></div>
</div>

<p>I viewed a large spot on June 19, 1889, and found its
major axis covered 2·6 divisions, = 59″·3<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>; so that its
apparent length was about 27,000 miles. For</p>

<p class="center">
1892″:866,000 miles :: 59″·3:27,143 miles.
</p>

<p>The same method may be adopted if the image is thrown
upon a screen.</p>

<p>Approximate values are to be obtained by means of fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
cross wires fixed in the eyepiece. Note the exact interval
occupied by the Sun in crossing the vertical wire, and also
the interval occupied by the large spot or group. If the Sun
is 133 seconds in passing the wire, and the group 6·5 seconds,
then</p>

<p class="center">
133 seconds:866,000 miles :: 6·5 seconds:42,323 miles.<br />
</p>

<p>This plan is likely to be most successful when the Sun is near
its meridian passage; but it may be applied at any hour, if
care is taken to adjust the eyepiece so that the Sun’s motion
is precisely at right angles to the vertical wire. One other
plan may be mentioned. Draw on cardboard, with compasses,
a circle about 10 or 12 inches diameter, and divide this with
31 parallel lines. Subdivide each of the spaces into 5, less
prominently marked. Then, during observation, keep both
eyes open, and hold or fix the circular disk at a distance
enabling it to coincide with the telescopic image of the
Sun. By carefully noting how many divisions the group
covers on the cardboard, its dimensions may be readily
found, because one division will be equal to about 5410
miles. Of course these methods<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> are simply approximate,
and only strictly applicable to objects not far removed from
the central regions of the Sun, because the spots are portions
of a sphere, and not angles subtended by a flat surface.
When close to the E. or W. limbs, foreshortening is considerable,
though the polar diameter of a spot is not affected
by it then.</p>

<p>Presuming an observer to have his 3-or 4-inch telescope
duly fitted with a solar diagonal and tinted glass, he may
naturally ask, after his curiosity has been satisfied by the
contemplation of his first sun-spot, what he can do further:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
What special features is he to look for? What changes
ought to be recorded? What are the doubtful points that
require to be cleared up as regards the Sun’s physical
appearance? In what way are new and novel facts likely to
be glimpsed? In a word, he desires to know in what manner
he may employ his eyes and instrument usefully for science,
while also gaining pleasure for himself. Information like
this is often needed by the young student, and sometimes
indeed by men who have already gained a little experience, and
who possess much larger instruments than we have intimated
above. In endeavouring to offer suggestions in response to
such inquiries, I would remark that the nature and direction
of a research essentially depend upon several conditions, viz.
the observer’s inclination, his instrumental equipment, his
place of observation, and the amount of time he can devote to
the pursuit of his object. There are very few men who, like
Schwabe of Dessau, will confront the Sun on nearly every day
for more than forty years in order to learn something of its
secrets. Such extraordinary pertinacity is fortunately not
required, except in special cases. Amateurs may effect much
valuable work in the short intervals which many of them steal
either from business or domestic ties and offer at the shrine
of astronomy.</p>

<p>There are quite a considerable number of attractive phenomena
and features on which the solar observer will find
ample employment, and to the principal of these it may be as
well to make individual references.</p>

<p><i>Eclipses of the Sun.</i>—These phenomena deservedly rank
amongst the most important and impressive events displayed
by the heavenly bodies, and they are specially interesting to
the possessors of small telescopes. Solar eclipses have been
so often made the subject of observation and discussion, that
our knowledge of the appearances presented may be considered
to be nearly complete. The various aspects of Nature
on such occasions have been so attentively studied in their
manifold bearings, that virtually nothing remains for the
ordinary observer but to reexamine and corroborate facts
already well ascertained. He can expect to glean few
materials in a field where a plentiful harvest has just been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
reaped. But the eclipsed Sun, if it has revealed most of its
secrets to previous investigators, has certainly not declined
in attractiveness; and the amateur will find the spectacle
still capable of exhibiting features which, though not full
of the charms of novelty, will be sufficiently striking and
diversified to be remembered long after the event has passed.</p>

</div>

<p>Eclipses recur in cycles of 18 years and 10 days (= 6585
days). This period was determined by the ancients, and
called the <i lang="el">saros</i>. By its means the times and magnitudes of
eclipses were roughly computed long before astronomy
became an exact science.</p>

<p>A solar eclipse is really an <em>occultation</em> of the Sun by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Moon; for the word <em>eclipse</em>, in its usual reference, denotes
the obscuration of one body by its immersion in the shadow
of another. During any single year there are never less than
two eclipses, nor more than seven. Whenever there are two
only, both are solar.</p>

<p>Since the fine solar eclipse of December 22, 1870, no large
eclipse of the Sun has been visible in England. It is
remarkable that during the thirty years from 1870 to 1900
these phenomena are all of an unimportant, minor character.
Within the thirty years following 1891 there will be twelve
solar eclipses, for which the Rev. S. J. Johnson has given
projections (as shown on p. 98) for the period of greatest
obscuration.</p>

<p>Total eclipses are extremely rare as regards their visibility
at a given station. Thus between 878 and 1715 not one was
observed at London, and during the next 500 years there
will be a similar absence of such a phenomenon. The observer
of total eclipses must perforce journey to those particular
tracts of the earth’s surface over which the band
of totality passes. On such occasions photography plays an
important part; and the corona, the red flames, the shadow-bands,
and numerous other features become the subjects of
necessarily hurried observation and record, for totality
endures for very few minutes<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>As regards ordinary partial eclipses, amateurs usually find
ample entertainment in noting the serrated aspect of the
Moon’s contour projected on the bright Sun. It is also
interesting to watch the disappearance and reappearance of
the solar spots visible at the time. Rather a low magnifying
power, with sufficiently expansive field to include the entire
disk, is commonly best for the purpose of these observations.</p>

<p><i>Periodicity of Spots.</i>—This detail may be said to have been
fully investigated. Schwabe and Wolf have accomplished
much in this direction. A work of this kind must, by the
nature of it, extend over many years and entail many thousands
of observations. It is therefore more suited to the
professional astronomer than to the amateur, whose attention
is more or less irregular owing to other calls. The sun-spot
cycle is one of about 11 years, during which there are alternately
few and many spots on the Sun. There appear to be
some curious fluctuations, disturbing the regular increase and
decrease in the number of spots; and these variations are
worthy of more attention. The following are the years of
observed maxima and minima of sun-spot frequency:—</p>

<p>These phenomena have been rare during the past few years.
The next maximum may be expected in about 1894, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
solar observers will probably have an abundance of new
materials to study.</p>

<p><i>Crateriform Structure.</i>—In 1769 Prof. Wilson, of Glasgow,
while watching a sun-spot with a Gregorian reflecting-telescope,
remarked that, as it approached near the limb, the
penumbra became much foreshortened on the interior side. He
inferred from this that the spots were cavities, and the idea
has been generally accepted; so that these objects are sometimes
termed solar craters, and commonly regarded as openings
in the luminous atmosphere of the Sun. But the conclusion
appears to be based on data not uniformly supporting it. In
1886 the Rev. F. Howlett published some observations which
“entirely militate against the commonly received opinion
that the spots are to any extent sunk in the solar surface as to
produce always those effects of perspective foreshortening of
the inner side of the penumbra (when near the limb) which
have been described in various works on astronomy.” In a
number of instances the penumbra is wider on the side
nearest the Sun’s centre, whereas the converse ought to be
the case on the cavity theory. The fine sun-spot of July
1889 offered an example of this; for when it was near the
W. limb the W. side of the penumbra was obviously much
narrower than the E. side, so that the appearance would
indicate the object as an elevation rather than a depression.
The observer should keep a register of the aspect of all pretty
large spots near the limb, and note the relative widths of the
E. and W. sides of the penumbra. An extensive table of such
results would be interesting, and certain to throw some light
on the theory of spot-structure. It is of course possible that
occasionally the inner side of the penumbra is broader than
the outer, and thus appears wider even on the limb, though
really forming the side of a shallow depression.</p>

<p>“<i>Willow-Leaves.</i>”—In 1861 the late Mr. Nasmyth announced
that the entire solar surface was composed of minute luminous
filaments in the shape of “willow-leaves,” which interlaced
one another in every possible variety of direction. This
alleged discovery only met with doubtful corroboration.
The objects were stated by some authorities to be simply
identical with the “corrugations” and “bright nodules” of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Sir W. Herschel. Mr. Stone called them “rice-grains.”
The eagle-eyed Dawes thought “granulations” a more
appropriate term, as it implied no consistency of form and
size. Secchi referred to them as oblong filaments, and
“rather like bits of cotton-wool of elongated form.” The
Rev. F. Howlett described the Sun as presenting a granulated,
mottled appearance in a 3-inch Dollond refractor, and
mentioned that on the morning of June 9, 1865, the aspect of
its surface was like that of new-fallen snow, the objects
“being not rounded but sharply angular.” The opinions of
observers were thus singularly diverse, and the result of
several animated discussions at the Royal Astronomical
Society was that little unanimity was arrived at, except as to
the fact that the Sun’s surface was crowded with small
luminous filaments of elongated form, and either rounded or
angular at the ends. There was no accord as to their precise
forms or distinctive manner of grouping. Some of the
observers averred that the “willow-leaves” or “rice-grains”
had no title whatever to be regarded as a new discovery, the
same appearances having been recognized long before. Gradually
the contention ceased, and though more than a quarter
of a century has passed since the discussion arose there has
been little new light thrown on the subject.</p>

<p>Amateurs will therefore do well to probe deeper into this
promising branch of solar observation. As Mr. Nasmyth
himself stated, considerable telescopic power is required,
combined with a good atmosphere. But comparatively small
instruments will also be useful, because of their excellent
definition and efficacy in displaying details on a brilliant
orb like the Sun. A power of 150 should be employed
in examining small regions of the general surface, and also
the edges of the umbra and penumbra of sun-spots. When
definition is unusually sharp, and the details very distinct,
the magnifying power should be increased if it can be done
with advantage; and the observer should utilize an occasion
like this to the utmost extent. On a really excellent day
more may be sometimes detected than during several weeks
when the atmosphere is only moderately favourable. The
observations, being of a critical nature, should not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
attempted in winter, when the Sun is low. I have frequently
secured fine views of the delicate structure of the
solar surface between about 8 and 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> in the summer
months; and this is often a convenient time for amateurs
to snatch a glimpse, before going to business.</p>

<p>With reference to the general question as to the existence
of the “willow-leaves,” my conception of the matter is that
the features described by Mr. Nasmyth are not new. His
drawing of a spot in Sir J. Herschel’s ‘Outlines’ and
Chambers’s ‘Descriptive Astronomy’ exhibits objects extremely
uniform in shape and size, and this uniformity I
have never observed in the penumbra of spots. As to the
engraving in the ‘Outlines,’ showing the aspect of the interlaced
“willow-leaves” on the general surface, this is also
not realized in observation. The “corrugations” and
“bright nodules” of Sir W. Herschel aptly represent what
is seen, and they are possibly identical with the “very small
bright and obscure points” and “lively and sombre streaks”
of Scheiner, though seen much better and in more profusion
of detail through the improved modern telescopes. The so-called
“willow-leaves” are rounded at the ends, and are
consistent neither in size nor shape. They encroach upon
the umbra of the spots, and give a thatched appearance to
the edges. The penumbra also shows this in its outer limits,
where it is also fringed with lenticular particles. Drawings
by Capocci and Pastorff seventy-five years ago, and published
in Arago’s ‘Popular Astronomy,’ show the thatching
at the edges of the umbra quite as palpably as it is represented
in recent drawings.</p>

<div class="caption">Belts of Sun-spots, visible October 29, 1868.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Rotation of the Sun.</i>—By noting when the same individual
spots return to the same relative places on the disk, the
approximate time of rotation is easily deduced. This varies
according to the latitude of the spots<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>; whence it is evident
the solar atmosphere is affected by currents of different velocities,
causing the spots to vary in their longitudes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
reference to each other. The Earth’s motion round the Sun
causes the spots to travel apparently more slowly than they
really do; for observations prove that a spot completes a rotation
in 27 days 5 hours, whereas the actual time, after making
allowance for the earth’s orbital motion, is about 25 days
7-3/4 hours. The period of rotation may be roughly found as
follows, supposing a spot to return to precisely the same part
of the disk in 27 days 5 hours:—</p>

<p>
365<sup>d</sup> 5<sup>h</sup> 49<sup>m</sup> + 27<sup>d</sup> 5<sup>h</sup> = 392 10<sup>h</sup> 49<sup>m</sup>.
</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>
392<sup>d</sup> 10<sup>h</sup> 49<sup>m</sup> (= 565,129<sup>m</sup>) : 365<sup>d</sup> 5<sup>h</sup> 49<sup>m</sup> (= 525,949<sup>m</sup>)</p>
<p>
:: 27<sup>d</sup> 5<sup>h</sup> (= 39,180<sup>m</sup>) : 25<sup>d</sup> 7<sup>h</sup> 44<sup>m</sup> (= 36,464<sup>m</sup>).<br />
</p>

<p>For exact results several circumstances have to be considered,
such as the direction of the spot-motions across the disk, as
the chords vary according to the season; thus in June and
December the spots traverse straight lines, while in March
and September their paths are curved, like a belt on Saturn
when the planet is inclined. Some of the spots display considerable
proper motion; so that it is best to observe a number
of these objects, and reduce the times to a mean result. They
are not very durable, rarely lasting longer than a few weeks;
but some of the more extensive disturbances are sustained for
several months, during which many singular changes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
effected. The period of rotation, as determined by several
observers, is as follows:—</p>

<p>The motion of rotation is similar in direction to that in
which the planets move found the Sun, namely from west to
east. Hence the spots come into view on the east limb of the
Sun, and disappear at the west.</p>

<p><i>Planetary Bodies in transit.</i>—During observation the
observer should particularly watch any very dark, small
spots that may be visible, such as are isolated and pretty
circular and definite in outline. If an object of this character
is seen it should be examined with a high power, and
its aspect critically noted. Should the observer entertain
any suspicion of its being of a planetary nature, he should
carefully determine its position on the disk, and, after a short
interval, re-observe it for traces of motion. If it remains
stationary, its true solar origin will be proved. If motion is
shown, then the successive positions of the object during its
transit, and its place of egress, with the time of each observation,
should be recorded. In such a case it would be a
good plan to project the Sun’s image, and mark the place of
the suspicious object and chief sun-spots at short intervals.
This would be more accurate than mere eye-estimation. The
observer who scans the solar surface for intra-Mercurial
planets must remember that, if any such bodies exist, they
will probably be very diminutive. Venus, when on the Sun
in December 1882, was a spot 63″ in diameter, and easily
perceptible to the naked eye. Mercury, at the transits of
1861, 1868, and 1881, was a little less than 10″, but in 1878<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
was 12″. If “Vulcan,” the suspected interior planet, has
any existence it may possibly be much smaller than Mercury,
and will thus escape observation, unless the observer
exercises great care in the search. The mobile, planetary
spots asserted to have been seen on the Sun in past years
prove nothing definite, and appear to have been illusory.</p>

<p><i>Proper Motion of Sun-spots.</i>—This feature is one deserving
more investigation. The distances separating individual
spots should either be measured with a micrometer or
determined by transits across a wire, and the displacement
recorded from hour to hour or from day to day. Spots
in different latitudes will almost certainly exhibit some
change of relative place; and objects in the same latitude
must be watched, for similar variations probably affect them.
The physical peculiarities of such spots should be remarked,
and also the alterations of appearance they undergo during
the time they approach or recede from each other.</p>

<p><i>Rise and Decay of Spots.</i>—Occasionally large spots are
formed in an incredibly short time, and the disappearance of
others has been equally sudden. Schwabe found, from many
observations, that the western spots of a group are obliterated
first; but authorities differ. I have usually observed that
the smaller, outlying members of a group vanish before the
larger spot, which then contracts and is invaded by tongues
of faculæ; so that its effacement soon follows, and nothing
remains to indicate the disturbance but bright ridges of
faculæ, which are very conspicuous near the limb.</p>

<p><i>Black Nuclei in the Umbræ.</i>—Dawes was the first to
announce that the umbra sometimes included a much darker
area or nucleus. This is present in nearly all large spots.
A part of the umbra seems covered or veiled by a slightly
luminous medium, and the portion unaffected looks black by
contrast. On October 1, 1881, with a 2½-inch refractor, I
saw a large sun-spot, the umbra of which was broken up into
7 fragments, and the S. preceding part appeared very black
while the others showed a much lighter tint. In the fine
spot of June 1889 a nucleus was also distinctly apparent;
and this feature is sometimes so obvious in large spots that
it may be observed with an instrument of only 2-inches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
aperture. I have usually remarked the nucleus on one side
of the umbra, and abutting the penumbra. It may be formed
by light patches of transparent material floating over the
umbra, and leaving a part free where the Sun’s dark body is
fully exposed. This light material is possibly suspended far
above the umbra and inconstant in its position; so that the
place and form of the nucleus should always be noted for
traces of change. It is necessary that such details should be
closely watched during an entire day, or several days; for
the variations could then be followed, and perhaps reduced to
some law. This persistence is very necessary, in order to
solve many of the peculiarities of sun-spots, which, though
pretty well known in appearance, have not been thoroughly
studied in their various developments.</p>

<p><i>Bright Objects near the Sun.</i>—Small, rapidly moving bodies
have been occasionally reported as seen passing over the Sun.
In several cases these have been prematurely assigned a
meteoric origin. They have been described as luminous
bodies of irregular shape, as moving in a common direction,
and as being very distinct when projected on the dark
sky just outlying the bright limb of the Sun. There is
little doubt they are either the pappus of different kinds
of seed, or convolutions of gossamer, which have been lifted
to great heights in the air, and are rendered bright by
reflection from the bordering Sun. In this connection I
may mention some observations of my own with a 4-inch
refractor:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">1889, May 20</span>, 0<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>—Bright points and little
misty forms kept passing from the Sun’s limb, at the average
rate of 13 in a minute. They moved in the same direction
as the clouds and wind. Some of them were followed by
tails, which were far from straight. I saw them best when I
focused the telescope for an object much nearer than the
Sun. One of these forms would occasionally halt and
pursue an irregular flight. It was evident they were terrestrial
objects, with motions controlled by the wind.</p>

<p>“3<sup>h</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>—Many bright objects still passing from the
Sun’s limb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">1889, May 22</span>, 9<sup>h</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>—Observed vast numbers of
luminous particles floating about contiguous to the Sun’s
margin. They were clearly carried along by the wind;
but this being very slight, their motions were extremely
slow, and now and then many of them became nearly
stationary. Their directions were far from uniform, though
the general tendency was obviously in a common line of
flight. I watched them for some time passing in a plentiful
shower.”</p>

<p>These objects are always noticed in summer-time, and
I believe they would much more frequently attract remark
but for the fact that they require a longer focus than the
Sun and cannot be recognized when on the disk, to which
the observer is usually giving the whole of his attention.
Those who are often employed in solar work will find it
an interesting diversion to look for these bodies. The
instrument should be focused as for a distant terrestrial
object, and only a part of the Sun’s limb should be retained
in the field of view of an eyepiece of moderately low power.
Then, looking intently at the dark sky near the limb, the
bright objects will be sometimes seen sailing past in considerable
numbers.</p>

<p><i>Cyclonic Action.</i>—The appearance in detail of certain
spots, coupled with evidences of rotatory motion round their
own centres, has induced the belief that they are liable to
action in some degree similar to the cyclonic storms<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> which
disturb and rend the terrestrial atmosphere. Such indications
should be looked for in fairly conspicuous spots, and
any peculiarities of the nature alluded to made the subject of
close investigation. A spot showing features having a spiral
tendency may not, however, have a gyratory movement about
its centre. This can only be determined by critically noting the
details, and frequently reobserving them for traces of motion.
The penumbra always shows radiations converging on the
umbra as a centre; but this is merely a form of structure,
and proves nothing in evidence of a revolving storm.</p>

<p><i>Sudden Outbursts of Faculæ.</i>—In September 1859 Carrington
and Hodgson independently observed a striking out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>burst
of faculæ in front of a large group of spots which they
were examining. It remained visible about five minutes,
during which interval several patches of light travelled over
a region nearly 34,000 miles in extent. An extraordinary
magnetic disturbance was simultaneously recorded at the
Kew Observatory, and sixteen hours afterwards there followed
a magnetic storm of unusual severity. On another
occasion Dr. Peters observed flashes of light cross and
recross the umbra of a prominent spot with electric velocity.
Some other startling observations of solar phenomena have
been effected, and there is no question as to their having
been matters of fact. In the presence of effects so sudden,
so obvious, and so unexpected, no wonder the observers at
first doubted the evidence of their eyes and suspected the
cause to lie in a fractured glass or a fault of adjustment.
But the corroboration afforded the clearest proof as to the
actuality of the events described. They will doubtless occur
again; but these phenomena cannot be definitely predicted
as to time, so that students of the solar surface should be
prepared for a repetition of them whenever they may occur.</p>

<p><i>Shadows cast by Faculæ.</i>—M. Trouvelot, while examining
a large sun-spot on May 26, 1878, noticed that it was “completely
surrounded by very brilliant and massive faculæ.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
“On one part of the penumbra an extraordinary appearance
was perceived, which resembled so closely a shadow, as it
would have been cast by the overhanging faculous mass,
that it seemed useless to seek, and it was impossible to admit,
any other explanation. This shadow, the outline of which
was a little diffused, had the same shape as, and reproduced
with great exactness, the outline of the faculous mass situated
above it. It was not so black as the opening in spots called
the umbra, but of a very dark tint.” A similar feature was
seen by Kirk and Maclean on May 2, 1884, and the ‘Observatory,’
vol. vii. pp. 146, 170, and 197, contains some interesting
particulars on this subject. Fig. 24 is a drawing by
Kirk, in which the shadow is represented by A, B; at C “it
accurately followed the outline of the intensely white margin
of the spot.”</p>

<p><i>Veiled Spots.</i>—The late Father Perry described these
objects at the R.A.S. meeting on May 9, 1884, and said they
are to be seen all over the face of the Sun. They only exist
for two or three minutes, and then disappear. In one
instance he observed a train of these veiled spots stretching
over “a tenth part of the Sun’s diameter, which was nearly
as obvious to the eye as the penumbra of an ordinary spot;
it split into two throughout its whole length, and disappeared
in a minute. The veiled spots seem to be of two classes:
the one appear like small greyish clouds, which disappear after
a few minutes, as if they were formed and rapidly evaporated
by the Sun’s heat, and the others seem to be connected with
the umbra of ordinary spots; they appear about them, and
are more permanent than the ordinary veiled spots, lasting
sometimes two or three days, but never longer.” These
markings appear to have been first detected by Trouvelot in
1875, and he gives some information as to this class of phenomena
in the ‘Observatory,’ vol. viii. pp. 228 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p><i>Recurrent Disturbances</i><a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.—It is supposed, and with good
evidence affirming the idea, that certain regions of the Sun’s
surface are subject to frequent outbursts of spots, which are
possibly due to forces acting from below the Sun’s bright
atmosphere. After the disappearance of large groups or
isolated spots it is therefore advisable to watch the same
region for some time afterwards, to find whether it remains
perfectly quiescent, or whether it soon again becomes a seat
of activity and change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p><i>Recurrent Forms.</i>—Certain spots observed at different
times have exhibited appearances so nearly resembling each
other that it has been considered the likeness may be due to
something more than mere accident. Whenever such suggestive
coincidences are recognized the observer should note
them particularly, and secure drawings. It should be his aim
to determine the exact intervals elapsing between the presentation
of spots or groups of this character, and also
whether they occupy the same latitude and longitude on the
Sun’s disk.</p>

<p><i>Exceptional Position of Spots.</i>—The ordinary spots are
rarely seen more than 35° distant from the solar equator or
within 8° of it. They usually appear in the zones from 8° to
20° N. and S. of the equator. A few exceptions may be
mentioned<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>. Mechain saw a spot in July 1780 having a
latitude of 40-1/3°; in April 1826 Capocci recorded one having
49° of S. latitude; Schwabe and Peters observed spots 50°
from the equator. Lahire, in the last century, described a
spot as visible in a latitude of 70°; but the accuracy of this
observation has been questioned. Whenever a spot is seen
near the equator, or very far removed from it, measures
should be taken of its exact place; for it is desirable to learn
something more of those disturbances which occasionally
affect the more barren regions of the solar envelope.</p>

<p><i>The Solar Prominences.</i>—Those amateurs who have included
a spectroscope in their instrumental outfit will find
the study of the chromosphere and prominences a most productive
one. Huggins and Zöllner were the first to apply
the “open-slit” method; and the study of the shape of the
hydrogen prominences commenced in 1869. Tupman details
(‘Monthly Notices R.A.S.,’ vol. xxxiii. p. 106) a series of
observations which he secured in 1872 with a refractor of
3-inches aperture and a direct-vision spectroscope of five
prisms. He mentions the cost of the entire apparatus as only
£18, and says he entertains “no doubt that an equally effective
instrument could be made for much less.” The prominences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
appear to be of different kinds, and are known as “cloud”-
and “flame”-prominences. Both are liable to rapid changes.
Trouvelot, in June 1874, noticed “a gigantic comma-shaped
prominence, 82,000 miles high, which vanished from before
his eyes by a withdrawal of light as sudden as the passage of
a flash of lightning.” Since the study of these remarkable
forms was rendered feasible by using a greater dispersion
to open the slit of the spectroscope wide enough to see them,
they have been made the subject of daily study and record.
The results, so far as they have been investigated, show that
the region of the Sun’s limb in which the prominences are
most frequent reaches to some 40° on either side of the
equator, which is somewhat greater than the area of sun-spot
frequency. The chromosphere itself is probably of much the
same character as the erupted prominences, and formed of
little flames arranged thickly together like “blades of grass.”</p>

<p>In observing the Sun with a telescope the amateur will soon
notice that the surface is far more brilliant in the central parts
than round the margin of the disk. Vögel has estimated that
immediately inside the edges the brightness does not amount
to one seventh that of the centre. The difference is entirely
due to the solar atmosphere, which is probably very shallow
relatively to the great diameter of the Sun.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p>Early in autumn, when the evenings are frequently clear,
many persons are led with more force than usual to evince an
interest in our satellite, and to desire information which may
not be conveniently obtained at the time. The aspect of the
Moon at her rising, near the time of the full, during the
months of August, September, and October, is more conspicuously
noticeable than at any other season of the year,
on account of the position she then assumes on successive
nights, enabling her to rise at closely identical times for
several evenings together. The appearance of her large,
ruddy globe at near the same hour, and her increasing brilliancy
as her horizontal rays give way under a more vertical
position, originated the title of “Harvest Moon,” to commemorate
the facility afforded by her light for the ingathering
of the corn preceding the time of the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>It will be universally admitted that the Moon possesses
special attractions for us, as being situated nearer than any
other celestial body, and forming the inseparable companion or
tributary world to the Earth. The many important influences
she exercises have led to her becoming the object of close investigation;
so that her motions and physical appearances have
been ascertained with a remarkable degree of exactness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
amplitude. Her movements regulate the tides; her positions
are of the utmost moment to the mariner; her light is the
welcome beacon of the wayfarer, and its picturesque serenity
has ever formed the theme of poets. To the practical astronomer
she constitutes an orb perfectly unique as regards
extent and variety of detail; and questions relating to the
physical condition of her surface, now and in past ages,
supply a fund of endless speculation to the theorist.</p>

<p>The mean apparent diameter of the Moon is 31′ 5″, and it
varies from 29′ 21″ at perigee to 33′ 31″ at apogee. Her
real diameter is 2160 miles, and her mean distance slightly
exceeds 237,000 miles. Her revolution round the Earth
(= sidereal period) is performed in 27<sup>d</sup> 7<sup>h</sup> 43<sup>m</sup> 11<sup>s</sup>·46, but
the time from one new moon to another (= synodical period)
is 29<sup>d</sup> 12<sup>h</sup> 44<sup>m</sup> 3<sup>s</sup>. The Moon’s motion through the firmament
is at the rate of 13° 10′ 35″ per day and 32′ 56″ per
hour. Thus she travels over a space slightly exceeding her
own diameter in one hour. The linear value of 1″ at the
distance of our satellite is 1·16 mile, and of 1′ 69½ miles.</p>

<p>When we critically survey the face of the Moon with
a good telescope, we see at once that her surface is broken up
into a series of craters of various sizes, and that some very
irregular formations are scattered here and there, which
present a similar appearance to elevated mountain-ranges.
The crateriform aspect of the Moon is perhaps the more
striking feature, from its greater extent; and we recognize
in the individual forms a <em>simile</em> to the circular cavities formed
in slag or some other hard substances under the action of
intense heat. In certain regions of the Moon, especially those
near the south pole, the disk is one mass of abutting craters,
and were it not for the obvious want of symmetry in form
and uniformity of size, the appearance would be analogous to
that of a gigantic honeycomb. These craters are commonly
surrounded by high walls or ramparts, and often include
conical hills rising from their centres to great heights. While
the eye examines these singular structures, and lingers
amongst the mass of intricate detail in which the whole
surface abounds, we cannot but feel impressed at the marvellous
sharpness of definition with which the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
features are presented to our view. It matters not to what
district we direct our gaze, there is the same perfect serenity
and clearness of outline. Not the slightest indication can be
discerned anywhere of mist or other obscuring vapours
hanging over the lunar landscape.</p>

<p><i>Absence of Air and Water.</i>—Now it is palpable from this
that the Moon has no atmosphere of sufficient density to render
itself appreciable; for such an appendage, if it existed in any
visible form, would at once obtrude upon the attention, and
we should probably recognize some of the characteristics
common to the behaviour of our terrestrial clouds. But
nothing of the kind is apparent on the Moon: there is
an unbroken transparency spread over the whole extent of
the Moon’s scenery; whence we conclude that if any air
exists on the surface it is of extremely attenuated nature, and
possibly confined to the bottom of the craters and low-lying
formations, which are arranged in such prolific manner on
our satellite.</p>

<p>Nor is there any perceptible intimation of water upon the
Moon. It is true that several dark grey patches have been
given names, leading one directly to the inference that lakes
and seas comprise part of the surface phenomena. Thus
there is the <i>Mare Serenitatis</i> (“the sea of serenity”) and
many other designations of similar import, which we cannot
but insist are wrongly applied and calculated to lead to misapprehension.
Before the invention of the telescope furnished
us with the means of accurately determining the character of
the lunar features, such apellations may have been considered
eligible; but now that the non-existence of water in any
extensive form is admitted, the titles are rendered obsolete.
Still their retention is in some respects advisable, for any
sweeping change in a recognized system of nomenclature
must cause confusion, and the names alluded to serve a useful
end in facilitating reference; so that, under the circumstances,
it would perhaps be unwise to attempt reform,
or to introduce an innovation which must occasion many
difficulties.</p>

<p><i>Only one Hemisphere visible.</i>—In discussing the nature
and appearances of the lunar formations, it must be dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>tinctly
understood that our remarks apply to those visible
on the side invariably turned towards the Earth. For, in
point of fact, there is a considerable expanse of the lunar
disk never perceptible from the Earth at all. This is occasioned
by the circumstance that the Moon rotates upon her
axis in precisely the same time as she revolves around the
Earth, and is therefore enabled to present the same side
towards us on all occasions. A slight tilting (called libration)
takes place, so that we are allowed a glimpse of fragments of
the side normally invisible, and its analogous aspect leads us
to suppose that there is no great distinction between the
features of the Moon’s visible and invisible hemispheres.
From exact computations it appears that we are enabled
to see a proportion of 59/100 of the surface, and that the
remaining 41/100 are permanently beyond our reach.</p>

<p><i>Earthshine.</i>—A few mornings before new moon, and on a
few evenings after it, the whole outline of the dark portion
of the lunar globe may be distinctly perceived. A feeble illumination
like twilight pervades the opaque part, and this is
really earthlight thrown upon our satellite, for near the
times of new moon the Earth appears at her brightest (her
disk being fully illuminated) as seen from the Moon. The
French term for this light is <i lang="fr">la lumière cendrée</i>, or “the
ashy light.” The appearance is often popularly referred to in
our own country as “the old Moon in the new Moon’s
arms.” Some of the old observers remarked that the
waning Moon showed this earthlight more strongly than the
new Moon.</p>

<p><i>Telescopic Observations of the Lunar Surface.</i>—Our telescopes
give by far the most pleasing view of the Moon when
she is in a crescent shape. At such a period the craters and
mountains, with their dark shadows, are splendidly displayed.
A good view is also obtainable with the Moon at first or last
quarter, or when the disk is gibbous. But the full Moon is
decidedly less attractive; for the shadows have all disappeared,
and the various formations have quite lost their
distinctive character. The disk is enveloped in a flood of
light, causing glare, and though there is a large amount
of detail, including systems of bright rays, many differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
of tint, and bright spots, yet the effect is altogether less satisfactory
than at the time of a crescent phase.</p>

<p>The nature of the work undertaken by the amateur must
largely depend upon his opportunities and the capacity of his
appliances. It is evident that in the investigation of lunar
details it is essential to be very particular in recording observations;
for unless the conditions of illumination are nearly
the same, lunar objects will present little resemblance. He
should therefore examine the formations at intervals of
59<sup>d</sup> 1<sup>h</sup> 28<sup>m</sup>, when the terminator is resting on nearly
identical parts of the surface. In periods of 442<sup>d</sup> 23<sup>h</sup>
(= 15 lunations) there is another repetition of similar phase;
also in periods of 502<sup>d</sup> 0<sup>h</sup> 28<sup>m</sup> (= 17 lunations).</p>

<p>The observer, in entering results into his note-book, should
state the Moon’s age to the nearest minute, and give aperture
and power of telescope and state of sky. Those objects
which he has recorded at one lunation should be re-observed
after an intervening lunation, or at intervals of 59<sup>d</sup> 1<sup>h</sup> 28<sup>m</sup>.
He will then find his notes and drawings are comparable. By
the persistent scrutiny of special structures he will discern
more and more of their details; in other words, he will find
his eye soon acquires power with experience and familiarity
with the object. Comparisons of his own work with the
charts and records of previous observers will be sure to
interest him greatly, and the differences which he will almost
certainly detect may exert a useful influence in inciting him
to ascertain the source of them. He must not be premature in
attributing such discordances to actual changes on the Moon;
for he must remember that perfect harmony is rarely to be found
in the experiences of different observers. But whenever his own
results are inconsistent with those of others, the fact should be
carefully noted and the observations repeated and rediscussed
with a view to reconcile them. The charts and descriptions of
former selenographers are excellent in their way, and the
outcome of much zealous labour; but they contain omissions
and inaccuracies which it has been impracticable to avoid.
The amateur who discovers a mountain, craterlet, or rill not
depicted on his lunar maps must therefore neither regard it
as a new formation or as a new discovery; for it may have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
overlooked by some of the previous observers, and is possibly
drawn or described in a work which he does not happen to
have consulted. Such differences should, however, always be
announced, as they clear the way for others working in the
same field.</p>

<p>A small instrument, with an object-glass of about 2½ inches,
will reveal a large amount of intricate detail on the surface of
our satellite, and will afford the young student many evenings
of interesting recreation. But for a more advanced survey of
the formations, with the view to discover unknown objects or
traces of physical change in known features, a telescope of at
least 8 or 10 inches aperture is probably necessary, and powers
of 300, 350, and more.</p>

<p><i>Eclipses of the Moon.</i>—These phenomena comprise a variety
of interesting aspects. They are less numerous, in actual
occurrence, than solar eclipses in the proportion of about
2 to 3; but they are more frequently visible, because they
may be witnessed from any part of an entire hemisphere,
whereas eclipses of the Sun are only observable from a tract
of the Earth’s surface not exceeding 180 miles in breadth.
The Moon may remain totally eclipsed for a period of 2 hours
4 minutes, and the whole duration, including the penumbral
obscuration from its first to its last projection, is about 6 hours.
Sometimes the Moon suffers total eclipse twice in the same
year, and both may be visible, as in 1844, 1877, 1964, &amp;c. It
is possible for three such eclipses to occur within a single year,
as in 1544. In 1917 there will be three total lunar eclipses,
but not all visible in England. In the latter year there will
be no less than seven eclipses, as in 1935.</p>

<p>On the last two occasions—Oct. 4, 1884, and Jan. 28,
1888—when the Moon was totally immersed in the Earth’s
shadow, the atmosphere was very clear; and it is hoped
equally favourable conditions will attend the similar phenomena
of Nov. 15, 1891, Sept. 4, 1895, and Dec. 27, 1898.
One of the most interesting features during these temporary
obscurations of our satellite is the occultation of small stars.
Prof. Struve compiled a list of no less than 116 of these objects
that would pass behind the Moon’s shadowed limb during the
eclipse of Oct. 4, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>Another important effect is the variable colouring on the
Moon. This differs considerably in relative intensity as seen
during successive eclipses, and the cause is not perhaps fully
accounted for. Kepler thought it due to differences in
humidity of those parts of the Earth’s atmosphere through
which the solar rays pass and are refracted to the eclipsed
Moon. The intense red hue which envelopes the lunar
surface on such occasions is due to the absorption of the blue
rays of light by our atmosphere. The sky at sunset is often
observed to be similarly coloured, and from the operation of
similar causes. Sometimes the Moon entirely disappears
when eclipsed, but on other occasions remains distinctly
obvious, like a bright red ball suspended in the firmament.
On May 5, 1110, Dec. 9, 1620, May 18, 1761, and June 10,
1816, our satellite is said to have become absolutely imperceptible
during eclipse. Wargentin, who described the
appearance in 1761, remarks:—“The Moon’s body disappeared
so completely that not the slightest trace of any
portion of the lunar disk could be discerned, either with the
naked eye or with the telescope.” On Oct. 4, 1884, I
noticed that the opacity was much greater than usual; at the
middle period of the eclipse the Moon’s diameter was apparently
so much reduced that she looked like a dull, faint,
nebulous mass, without sharply determinate outlines. The
effect was similar to that of a star or planet struggling
through dense haze. Yet, on March 19, 1848, the Moon
“presented a luminosity quite unusual. The light and dark
places on the face of our satellite could be almost as well
made out as on an ordinary dull moonlight night.” On
July 12, 1870, Feb. 27 and Aug. 23, 1877, and Jan. 28,
1888, the Moon, as observed at Bristol, was also fairly bright
when totally immersed in the Earth’s shadow. In explanation
of these singular differences, Dr. Burder has suggested
that Kepler’s views seem inadequate, and that the solar
corona is probably implicated in producing light and dark
eclipses. He concludes that, as the corona sometimes extends
to considerable distances from the Sun, and is very variable
in brightness, it may have sufficient influence to occasion the
effects alluded to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p><i>Lunar Changes.</i>—The question as to whether physical
changes are occurring in the surface-formations of our
satellite is one which offers attractive inducements to telescopic
observers. Though the Moon appears to have passed
the active state, it is very possible that trivial alterations
continue to affect some of her features. In April 1787
Sir W. Herschel wrote:—“I perceive three volcanoes in
different places of the dark part of the new Moon. Two of
them are already nearly extinct, or otherwise in a state of
going to break out; the third shows an eruption of fire
or luminous matter.” Schröter, however, was correctly of
opinion that these appearances were due to reflected light
from the Earth falling upon elevated spots of the Moon
having unusual capacity to return it. Schröter himself
thought he detected sudden changes in 1791. He says
that, on the 30th of December, at 5<sup>h</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, with a 7-foot
reflector magnifying 161 times, he perceived the commencement
of a small crater on the S.W. declivity of the volcanic
mountain in the Mare Crisium, having a shadow of at least
2′ 5″. On the 11th of January, 1792, at 5<sup>h</sup> 20<sup>m</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, on
looking at the place again he could see neither the new
crater nor its shadow. In this case the disappearance was
doubtless an apparent one, merely due to the reversed illumination
under which the object was examined in the interval
of 12 days.</p>

<p>Many other observers besides Herschel have been struck
with the brightness of certain spots situated in the opaque
region of the lunar disk; but there is no doubt the cause has
been uniformly one and the same, viz. the highly reflective
properties of some of the mountains (notably of one named
Aristarchus), which are distinctly visible as luminous spots
amid the relatively dark regions surrounding them. They
afford no certain evidence of existing volcanic energy, and
in the light of modern researches such an idea cannot be
entertained.</p>

<p>On June 10, 1866, Temple noticed a remarkable light
appearance, agreeing with the position of Aristarchus, upon
the dark side of the Moon, faintly illuminated by earthshine.
The object did not exhibit a faint white light analogous to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
that of other craters in the dark side, but it was star-like,
diffused, in colour reddish yellow, and evidently dissimilar to
other bright spots. He wrote, in reference to this matter:—“Of
course I am far from surmising a still active chemical
outbreak, as such an outbreak supposes water and an atmosphere,
both of which are universally allowed not to exist on
the Moon, so that the crater-forming process can only be
thought of as a dry, chemical, although warm one.”</p>

<p>On November 17, 1866, Schmidt announced that the lunar
crater Linné, about 5½ miles in diameter, and situated in the
Mare Serenitatis, had disappeared! He averred that he had
been familiar with the object as <em>a deep crater</em> since 1841, but
in October 1866 he found its place occupied by <em>a whitish
cloud</em>. This cloud was always visible, but the crater itself
appeared to have become filled up, and was certainly
invisible under its former aspect. Such a definite statement,
emanating as it did from a diligent and experienced
student of selenography, naturally aroused keen interest, and
Linné at once became the object of wide-spread observation.
But a reference to Schröter’s results, obtained in the latter
part of the last century, threw some doubt upon the alleged
change. This observer had figured Linné on November 5,
1788, as a round white spot, and there is nothing in his
drawing indicating a crateriform aspect. His description
of Linné was:—“A flat, somewhat doubtful crater, which
appears as a round white spot.” Mr. Huggins regarded
Schröter’s observations as correctly expressing the appearance
of this object in 1867 under the same conditions of illumination.
On the other hand, Lohrmann (1823) and Mädler
(1831) referred to Linné as a deep crater, and in terms
inconsistent both with Schröter’s drawing and with the
present aspect of the object. The outcome of the many
fresh observations that were collected was that Linné
appeared as a white cloud, with a small black crater within a
large shallow-ringed depression. But as usual in such cases,
the observers were far from being unanimous as to the details
of the formation; and certainly in regard to a lunar object this
need occasion no surprise, for slight differences in the angle
of illumination produce marked changes in the aspect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
lunar features. The fact of actual change could not be
demonstrated, and the negative view appears to have subsequently
gained weight.</p>

<p>Another instance of alleged activity on the Moon was
notified by Dr. Klein in the spring of 1877. He saw a deep
black crater about 18 miles to the W.N.W. of Hyginus, and
in a particular place where he had previously recognized no
such object, though he had frequently examined the region
and was perfectly familiar with it. Forthwith every telescope
was directed to this part of the Moon. The maps of
earlier observers were eagerly consulted, and lunar photographs
scanned for traces of the new object. Many drawings
were made of the district near Hyginus and of the remarkable
rill or cleft connected with it; but amongst both old and new
records some puzzling discordances were detected. Many of
the observers, instead of finding Dr. Klein’s new formation a
sharply-cut, deep crater, saw it rather in the character of
a saucer-like depression; and I drew it under this aspect on
several occasions with a 10-inch reflector. The fact, therefore,
of its being a new feature admitted of no valid and
convincing proofs, and thus the same uncertainty remains
attached to this object as to Linné, nothing being absolutely
proved<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>. The problem as to whether the Moon is still the
seat of physical activity has yet to be solved.</p>

<p>Many circumstances are antagonistic to the discovery of
changes on the Moon. As the Sun’s altitude is constantly
varying with reference to lunar objects, they assume different
aspects from hour to hour. In a short interval the same
formations become very dissimilar. When the Sun is rising
above the more minute craters they are often distinguished in
their true characters; but near the period of full Moon they
are visible as bright spots, and it is impossible to tell whether
they represent craters or conical hills. With a vertical Sun,
as at the full, all the shadows have disappeared—in fact, the
entire configuration has been transformed, and many of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
interesting lineaments displayed at the crescent phase are no
longer seen. The Moon’s libration also introduces slight
differences in the appearance of objects. And these are not
the only drawbacks; for observations, in themselves, are
seldom accordant, and it is found that drawings and descriptions
are not always to be reconciled, though referring to
identical and invariable features. The lunar landscape must
be studied under the same conditions of illumination and
libration, with the same instrument and power, and in a
similar state of atmosphere, if results are to be strictly comparable.
But it is very rarely that observations can be
effected under precisely equal conditions; hence discordances
are found amongst the records.</p>

<p>The whole of the Moon’s visible sphere exhibits striking
imprints of convulsions and volcanic action in past times,
though no such forces appear to operate now. The surface
seems to have become quiescent, and to have assumed a
rigidity inconsistent with the idea of present energy. But
we cannot be absolutely certain that minute changes are not
taking place, and, being minute, the prospect of their detection
is somewhat remote. Students of lunar scenery will probably
have to watch details with scrupulous care and for long periods
before an instance of real activity can be demonstrated.</p>

<p><i>Lunar Formations.</i>—The Moon abounds in objects of very
diversified character, and they have been classified according
to peculiarities of structure. The names of eminent astronomers
have been applied to many of the more definite
features—a plan of nomenclature which originated with
Riccioli, who published a lunar map at the middle of the
seventeenth century. The following brief summary comprises
many of the principal formations:—</p>

<p><i>Mare.</i> A name applied by Hevelius to denote the large and
relatively level plains on the Moon, which present some
similarity to terrestrial seas. They are visible to the naked
eye as dusky spots, and in a telescope show many craters,
hills, and mounds, and some extensive undulations of surface.</p>

<p><i>Palus</i> (Marsh) and <i>Lacus</i> (Lake) were titles given by
Riccioli to minor areas of a dark colour, and exhibiting
greater variety of detail and tint than the <i>Maria</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p><i>Sinus</i> (Bay) has been applied to objects like deep bays on
the borders of the <i>Maria</i>.</p>

<p><i>Walled Plains</i> extend from 40 to 150 miles in diameter,
and are commonly surrounded by a terraced wall or mountain-ranges.
The interiors are tolerably level, though often marked
with crater-pits, mounds, and ridges.</p>

<p><i>Mountain-Rings.</i> These represent rings of mountains and
hills, enclosing irregularities, possibly furnished by the debris
of the crumbling exterior walls, which, in certain instances,
appear to have fallen inwards.</p>

<p><i>Ring-Plains</i> are more circular and regular in type than
the walled plains, and consist of a moderately flat surface
surrounded by a single wall. <i>Crater-Plains</i> are somewhat
similar, and seldom exceed 20 miles in diameter. They “rise
steeply from the mass of debris around the foot of their walls
to a considerable height, and then fall precipitously to the
interior in a rough curved slope, whilst on their walls,
especially on the exterior, craterlets and crater-cones often
exist in considerable numbers.”</p>

<p><i>Craters, Craterlets, and Crater-Pits.</i> Usually circular in
form, and severally offering distinctions as to dimensions and
shape. The craters are surrounded by walls, rising abruptly
to tolerable heights, and pretty regular in their contour.
When the Sun is rising the shadow of the walls falls upon the
interior of the craters, and many of these dark conspicuous
objects are to be seen near the Moon’s terminator. With a
high Sun some of the craters are extremely bright. In proof
of the large number of these objects, it may be noted here
that in Mädler’s lunar map (1837) 7735 craters are figured,
while in Schmidt’s (1878) there are no less than 32,856!</p>

<p><i>Crater-Cones.</i> Conical hills or mountains, visible as small
luminous spots about the period of full Moon. They are from
1/2 to 3 miles in diameter, and show deep central depressions.
It is somewhat difficult to distinguish them from the ordinary
mountain-peaks and white spots, and they are not unlike the
cones of terrestrial volcanoes.</p>

<p><i>Rills or Clefts.</i> These are very curious objects. They were
first discovered by Schröter in 1787, and some of them are to
be traced over a considerable extent of the lunar surface,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
their entire length being 200 or 300 miles. They have the
appearance of cuttings or canals, and are sometimes straight,
sometimes bent, and not unfrequently develop branches which
intersect each other. They apparently run without interruption
through many varieties of lunar objects. The bottoms
of these rills are nearly flat, and look not unlike dried riverbeds.
Some observers have regarded them as fractures or
cracks in the Moon’s surface; but their appearance and circumstances
of arrangement are opposed to such a view. Our
present knowledge includes more than 1000 of these rills.</p>

<p><i>Mountain-Ranges</i> are chains of lofty peaks and highlands,
sometimes divided by rills and numerous ravines and cross
valleys. Some of these ranges are of vast magnitude, and the
summits of the mountains reach altitudes between 15,000 and
20,000 feet, and sometimes even more.</p>

<p><i>Mountain-Ridges</i> are to be found scattered in the greatest
abundance in the most disturbed localities of the lunar surface.
They sometimes connect several formations, or surmount
ravines or depressions of large extent. Peaks attaining
altitudes of more than 5000 feet rise from them, and they
range in several cases over 100 miles.</p>

<p><i>Ray-Centres.</i> Systems of radiating light-streaks, having a
mountain-ring as the centre of divergence, and stretching to
distances of some hundreds of miles round. Tycho, Copernicus,
Kepler, Anaxagoras, Aristarchus, and Olbers are pronounced
examples of this class.</p>

<p>In Beer and Mädler’s chart of the Moon the names are
attached to the various formations, as they are also in
Neison’s maps and in some other works. One of these will
be absolutely necessary to the student in prosecuting his
studies. He will then have a ready means of acquainting
himself with the various formations, and making comparisons
between his new results and the drawings of earlier selenographers.
I would refer the reader to Neison’s and Webb’s
books for many references in detail to lunar features, and
must be content here with a brief description of a few leading
objects:—</p>

<p><i>Plato</i> is an extensive walled plain, 60 miles in diameter,
and situated on the N.E. boundary of the Mare Imbrium.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Nasmyth and Carpenter describe the wall as “serrated with
noble peaks, which cast their black shadows across the plateau
in a most picturesque manner, like the towers and spires of a
great cathedral.” It has received a large amount of attention,
with a view to trace whether changes are occurring in the
numerous white spots and streaks lying in its interior. In
1869-71 Mr. Birt collected many observations, and on discussing
them was led to believe that “there is strong probability
that activity, of a character sufficient to render its
effects visible, had been manifested.” The inquiry was
renewed by Stanley Williams in 1882-84, and he concluded
that the results were strongly confirmatory of actual change
having occurred since 1869-71. The relative visibility of
several of the bright spots had altered in the interim, and the
curious intermingling bright streaks also exhibited traces of
variation. At sunrise the interior of Plato is pure grey; but
with the sun at a considerable height above it, the plain
becomes a dark steel-grey. The change is an abnormal one,
and difficult to explain. South of Plato there is a fine
example of an isolated peak, named Pico, which is about
8000 feet high.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p><i>Great Alpine Valley.</i> This object, supposed to have been
discovered by Bianchini in 1727, and having a length,
according to Mädler, of 83 miles and a breadth varying from
3½ to 6 miles, is a very conspicuous depression situated near
Plato, and running from the Mare Frigoris to the Mare
Imbrium. It exhibits at its southern extremity an oval
formation, and a narrow gorge issues from it to the northward,
opening out further on, and imparting to the whole
appearance a shape which Webb likened to a Florence oil-flask.
Elger has fully described this singular structure. “It
is only when far removed from the terminator that its V-shaped
outlet to the Mare Imbrium flanked on either side by the lofty
Alps can be traced to advantage, or the flask-like expansion
with the constricted gorge leading up to it from the N.W.
satisfactorily observed. At other times these features are
always more or less concealed by the shadows of neighbouring
heights. The details of the upper or more attenuated end of
the valley are, however, best seen under a setting sun, when
many striking objects come to light, of which few traces
appear at other times.”</p>

<p><i>Archimedes.</i> One of the most definite and regular of the
walled plains. It is 60 miles in diameter, with a wall rising
about 4200 feet above the surface. Some small craters and
various streaks diversify its centre.</p>

<p><i>Tycho.</i> A grand ring-plain, 54 miles in diameter and about
17,000 feet (= nearly 3 miles) deep, and forming the centre
of the chief ray-system of the Moon. The light-radiations
stretch over one fourth of the visible hemisphere at the full,
but they are imperceptible with the Sun’s altitude below 20°.
These remarkable radiations from Tycho form a striking
aspect of lunar scenery, and any small telescope reveals them.
Webb has termed Tycho “the metropolitan formation of the
Moon;” and the idea embodied in the expression must strike
observers as very apposite. This object is visible to the naked
eye at the time of full. A fine hill rises from its centre to a
height of 5500 feet.</p>

<p><i>Copernicus.</i> A magnificent ring-plain, 56 miles in diameter,
and surrounded by a wall (in which there are terraces
and lofty peaks, separated by ravines) attaining an elevation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
of 11,000 feet. There is a central hill of nearly 2500 feet.
From Copernicus light-streaks are plentifully extended on all
sides, and apparently connect this object with the many
others of similar character which are situated in this region.
Neison says that near Copernicus the light-streaks unite and
form a kind of nimbus or light-cloud about it. The streaks
are most conspicuous towards the N., where they are from
5 to 14 miles in width. To the N.W. of Copernicus, about
halfway in the direction of the neighbouring ring-plain
<i>Eratosthenes</i> (and N. of Stadius), there is a considerable
number of crater-pits. Mädler figured sixty-one of these,
and regarded that number as certainly less than half the
total number visible. They appear to be ranged in rows
or streams, and are so close together in places as to nearly
form crater-rills. Schmidt saw the ground hereabout
pierced like a honeycomb, and managed to count about
300 little craters; but they are so thickly strewn in this
district that exact numbers or places cannot be assigned.
They are best observable when the Sun is rising on the
E. wall of Copernicus. The interior of this fine object shows
six or seven peaks, which are often capped with sunshine, and
very brilliant amid the black shadow thrown from the surrounding
wall.</p>

<p><i>Theophilus.</i> Another ring-plain, and one of the deepest
visible. Its terraced lofty wall, 64 miles in diameter, rises
in a series of peaks to heights varying between 14,000 and
18,000 feet. There is a central mountain, broken by ravines;
but from one of the masses a peak ascends to a height of
about 6000 feet.</p>

<p><i>Petavius.</i> A large walled plain, surrounded by a double
wall or rampart, which rises to 11,000 feet on its E. side.
There are hills and ridges in the interior, and a central
peak, A, reaching to 5500 feet above the E. part of the floor,
which is convex in form. A smaller peak, of nearly 4000 feet,
lies W. of A. Several small craterlets have been seen in the
interior.</p>

<p><i>Newton.</i> The deepest walled plain known upon the Moon’s
surface. In form it is elliptical; its length is 143 miles,
while its breadth is only 69 miles. The walls show the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
terracing so common in these objects, and one lofty peak
reaches the unusual height of 24,000 feet above the floor.
The interior includes some small craters, mountain protuberances,
and other irregularities. Neison says that, owing
to “the immense height of the wall, a great part of the floor
is entirely lost in shadow, neither Earth nor Sun being ever
visible from it.”</p>

</div>

<p><i>Grimaldi.</i> An immense walled plain, extending over
148 miles from N. to S. and about 130 miles from E. to W.
Its interior is very dark. <i>Clavius</i> is another grand example<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
of this class of object, and is rather larger than Grimaldi, but
unfavourably placed near the S. pole. <i>Schickard</i> may also be
mentioned as a large formation of similar type, and situated
near the S.E. limb of the Moon.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Rill or Cleft of Hyginus.</i> A conspicuous example of the
lunar rills, and one which yields to very moderate instruments.
Neison notes that it is readily visible in a 2-inch
telescope; while Webb remarks that a power of only 40, in a
good instrument, is enough to show it under any illumination.
The rill is about 150 miles long. It cuts through a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
of crater-pits, and Mädler found so many widenings in it
that it appeared like a confluent train of craters. The rill
traverses the large crater-pit Hyginus, which is 3-3/4 miles in
diameter and moderately deep. Other fine examples of rill-systems
will be found between Rheita and Metius and near
Triesnecker and Ramsden.</p>

<p><i>Straight Wall.</i> A singular structure on the E. side of the
ring-plain Thebit. It is a ridge or wall, which looks regular
enough for a work of art, according to Webb. Its average
height is 450 feet (Schröter), 1004 feet (Mädler), or 880 feet
(Schmidt). These several determinations are given to show
the discordances sometimes found in the measures of good
observers. This object is about 60 miles long; at one
extremity lies a small crater, at the other there is a branching
mountain nearly 2000 feet high. Elger has drawn this
object, under both a rising and a setting sun, in the Liverpool
Astronomical Society’s ‘Journal,’ vol. v. p. 156, and remarks
that it may be well observed at from 20 to 30 hours after the
Moon’s first quarter.</p>

<p><i>Valley near Rheita.</i> South of the ring-plain Rheita, on the
S.W. limb, there is an enormous valley, which extends in its
entire length over 187 miles, with a width ranging from 10
to 25 miles. There are several fine valleys in this particular
region.</p>

<p><i>Leibnitz Mountains.</i> These are really situated on the further
hemisphere of the Moon, but libration brings them into view,
and they are sometimes grandly seen in profile on the
S. margin. Four of the peaks ascend to elevations of
26,000 or 27,000 feet, and one mass, towering far above
the others, is fully 30,000 feet in height, and is unquestionably
the most lofty mountain on the Moon.</p>

<p><i>Dörfel Mountains.</i> Visible on the Moon’s S.S.E. limb. They
exhibit three peaks, which, on the authority of Schröter, rise
to more than 26,000 feet above the average level of the limb.
The loftiest mountains on the Earth are in the Himalayas—a
range of immense extent to the N. of India. The three
highest peaks are Mount Everest (29,002 feet), Kunchinjinga
(28,156 feet), and Dhawalagiri (28,000 feet). The only lunar
mountain more elevated than these is that of the Leibnitz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
range, which, as we have already stated, ascends to fully
30,000 feet.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Apennines.</i> A vast chain of mountains, extending over
more than 450 miles of the lunar surface. <i>Huygens</i> is
the most elevated peak, rising to more than 18,000 feet,
and on its summit it shows a small crater. There are several
other very lofty peaks in this range. The Sun rises upon the
westerly region of these mountains at the time of first quarter,
and the peaks and ridges, with their contrasting shadows,
create a gorgeous effect just within, and projecting into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
darkness beyond, the terminator. There is an immense
amount of detail to be studied here, and much of it is within
the reach of small instruments.</p>

<p>As the lunar mountains and craters are best seen near the
terminator, it may be useful to give a table of objects thus
favourably placed between the times of new and full Moon.
The summary may assist the student, though it does not aim
at exactness, only even days being given.</p>

<p><i>Occultations of Stars.</i>—Among the various phenomena to
which the lunar motions give rise none are more pleasing to
the possessors of small telescopes than occultations of stars.
Several of these occurrences are visible every month. If the
amateur has the means of obtaining accurate time, he will engage
himself usefully in noting the moments of disappearance
and reappearance of the stars occulted. This work is efficiently
done, it is true, at some of our observatories, and therefore little
<em>real</em> necessity exists for amateurs to embark in routine work
which can be conveniently undertaken at establishments where
they have better appliances and trained observers to use them.
The mere watching of an occultation, apart from the registry of
exact results, is interesting; and there are features connected
with it which have proved exceedingly difficult to account for.
The stars do not always disappear instantaneously. On coming
up to the edge of the Moon they have not been suddenly
blotted out, but have appeared to hang on the Moon’s limb for
several seconds. This must arise from an optical illusion, from
the action of a lunar atmosphere, or the stars must be observed
through fissures on the Moon’s edge. The former explanation
is probably correct; for it has happened that two observers at
the same place have received different impressions of the phenomenon.
One has seen the star apparently projected on the
Moon’s limb for about 5 seconds, while the other has witnessed
its sudden extinction, in the usual manner, as it met the Moon’s
edge. New observations, made with good instruments and
reliable eyes, and fully described, will doubtless throw more
light on the peculiar effects sometimes recorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p><i>Visibility of the new and old Moon.</i>—It is an interesting
feature of observation to note how soon after conjunction
the Moon’s thin crescent is observable with the naked eye.
A case has been mentioned in which the old Moon was
seen one morning before sunrise and the new Moon just
after sunset on the next day. At Bristol, on the evening
of March 30, 1881, I saw the new Moon at 7<sup>h</sup> 10<sup>m</sup>, the
horizon being very clear in the west. She was then only
20<sup>h</sup> 38<sup>m</sup> old. On June 4, 1875, I observed the Moon’s
crescent at 9<sup>h</sup> 10<sup>m</sup>, or 22<sup>h</sup> 49<sup>m</sup> after new Moon. Dr. Degroupet,
of Belgium, saw the old Moon on the morning of
Nov. 22, 1889, between 6<sup>h</sup> 47<sup>m</sup> and 7<sup>h</sup> 22<sup>m</sup> G.M.T., or
within 18<sup>h</sup> 22<sup>m</sup> of the time of new Moon.</p>

<p><i>Supposed planet “Vulcan.”</i>—Mercury is the nearest known
planet to the Sun. It is true that a body, provisionally
named Vulcan<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>, has been presumed to exist in the space
interior to the orbit of Mercury; but absolute proof is
lacking, and every year the idea is losing strength in the
absence of any confirmation of a reliable kind. Certain
planetary spots, observed in motion on the solar disk, were
reported to have been transits of this intra-Mercurial orb.
Some eminent astronomers were thus drawn to take an
affirmative view of the question, and went so far as to
compute the orbital elements and predict a few ensuing
transits of the suspected planet. But nothing was seen
at the important times, and some of the earlier observations
have been shown to possess no significance whatever, while
grave doubts are attached to many of the others. Not one
of the regular and best observers of the Sun has recently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
detected any such body during its transits (which would be
likely to occur pretty frequently), and there is other evidence
of a negative character; so that the ghost of Vulcan may be
said to have been laid, and we may regard it as proven that
no major planet revolves in the interval of 36,000,000 miles
separating Mercury from the Sun.</p>

<p><i>Visibility of Mercury.</i>—Copernicus, amid the fogs of the
Vistula, looked for Mercury in vain, and complained in his
last hours that he had never seen it. Tycho Brahe, in the
Island of Hueen, appears to have been far more successful.
The planet is extremely fugitive in his appearances, but is
not nearly so difficult to find as many suppose. Whenever
the horizon is very clear, and the planet well placed,
a small sparkling object, looking more like a scintillating
star than a planetary body, will be detected at a low altitude
and may be followed to the horizon.</p>

<p><i>Period &amp;c.</i>—Mercury revolves round the Sun in
87<sup>d</sup> 23<sup>h</sup> 15<sup>m</sup> 44<sup>s</sup> in an eccentric orbit, so that his distance
from that luminary varies from 43,350,000 to 28,570,000
miles. When in superior conjunction the apparent diameter
of the planet is 4″·5; at inferior, conjunction it is 12″·9,
and at elongation 7″. His real diameter is 3000 miles.</p>

<p><i>Elongations.</i>—Being situated so near to the Sun, it is
obvious that to an observer on the Earth he must always
remain in the same general region of the firmament as that
body. His orbital motion enables him to successively assume
positions to the E. and W. of the Sun, and these are known
as his elongations, which vary in distance from 18° to 28°.
He becomes visible at these periods either in the morning or
evening twilight, and under the best circumstances may
remain above the horizon two hours in the absence of the
Sun. The best times to observe the planet are at his
E. elongations during the first half of the year, or at his
W. elongations in the last half; for his position at such times
being N. of the Sun’s place, he remains a long while in view.
It is unfortunate that when the elongation approaches its
extreme limits of 28° the planet is situated S. of the Sun, and
therefore not nearly so favourably visible as at an elongation
of only 18° or 20°, when his position is N. of the Sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>I have seen Mercury on about sixty-five occasions with the
naked eye. In May 1876 I noticed the planet on thirteen
different evenings, and between April 22 and May 11, 1890,
I succeeded on ten evenings. I believe that anyone who
made it a practice to obtain naked-eye views of this object
would succeed from about twelve to fifteen times in a year.
In a finer climate, of course, Mercury may be distinguished
more frequently. Occasionally he presents quite a conspicuous
aspect on the horizon, as in February 1868, when I
thought his lustre vied with that of Jupiter, and in November
1882, when he shone brighter than Sirius. The planet is
generally most conspicuous <em>a few mornings after his W. elongations</em>
and <em>a few evenings before his E. elongations</em>.</p>

<p><i>Amateur’s First View.</i>—The first view of Mercury forms
quite an event in the experience of many amateurs. The
evasive planet is sought for with the same keen enthusiasm
as though an important discovery were involved. For a few
evenings efforts are vain, until at length a clearer sky and a
closer watch enables the glittering little stranger to be caught
amid the vapours of the horizon. The observer is delighted,
and, proud of his success, he forthwith calls out the members
of his family that they, too, may have a glimpse of the
fugitive orb never seen by the eye of Copernicus.</p>

<p><i>Phases.</i>—In the course of his orbital round Mercury
exhibits all the phases of the Moon. Near his elongations
the disk is about half illuminated, and similar in form to that
of our satellite when in the first or third quarter. But the
phase is not to be distinctly made out unless circumstances
are propitious. Galilei’s telescope failed to reveal it, and
Hevelius, many years afterwards, found it difficult. This is
explained by the small diameter of the planet and the rarity
with which his disk appears sharply defined. The phase
is sometimes noted to be less than theory indicates; for the
planet has been seen crescented when he should have presented
the form of a semicircle. Several observers have also remarked
that his surface displays a rosy tint, and that the terminator
is more deeply shaded and indefinite than that of Venus.</p>

<p><i>Atmosphere.</i>—The atmosphere of Mercury is probably far less
dense than that of Venus. The latter being farthest from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Sun might be expected to shine relatively more faintly than the
former, but the reverse is the case. Mercury has a dingy aspect
in comparison with the bright white lustre of Venus. On
May 12, 1890, when the two planets were visible as evening
stars, and separated from each other by a distance of only 2°, I
examined them in a 10-inch reflector, power 145. The disk
of Venus looked like newly-polished silver, while that of Mercury
appeared of a dull leaden hue. A similar observation was
made by Mr. Nasmyth on September 28, 1878. The explanation
appears to be that the atmosphere of Mercury is
of great rarity, and incapable of reflection in the same high
degree as the dense atmosphere of Venus.</p>

<p><i>Telescopic Observations.</i>—As this planet is comparatively
seldom to be observed under satisfactory conditions, it is
scarcely surprising that our knowledge of his appearance is
very meagre, or that amateurs consider the planet an object
practically inaccessible as regards the observation of physical
peculiarities, and one upon which it is utterly useless to apply
the telescope in the hope of effecting new discoveries. Former
attempts have proved the extreme difficulty of obtaining good
images of this planet. The smallness of the disk, and the fact
that it is usually so much affected by the waves of vapour
passing along the horizon as to be constantly flaring and
moulding in a manner which scarcely enables the phase to be
made out, are great drawbacks, which render it impossible to
distinguish any delicate features that may be presented on the
surface.</p>

<p>These circumstances are well calculated to lead observers to
abandon this object as one too unpromising for further study;
but I think the view is partly induced by a misconception.
The planet’s diminutive size is a hindrance which cannot be
overcome; but the bad definition, resulting from low altitude,
may be obviated by those who will select more suitable times
for their observations and not be dismayed if their initiatory
efforts prove futile. As a naked-eye object, Mercury must
necessarily be looked for when near the horizon; but there is
no such need in regard to telescopic observation, which ought
to be only attempted when the planet surmounts the dense
lower vapours and is placed at a sufficient elevation to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the instrument a fair chance of producing a steady image.
The presence of sunshine need not seriously impair the
definition or make the disk too faint for detail.</p>

<p>I have occasionally seen Mercury, about two or three hours
after his rising, with outlines of extreme sharpness and quite
comparable with the excellent views obtained of Venus at the
time of sunrise or sunset. Those who possess equatoreals
should pick up the planet in the afternoon and follow him
until after sunset, when the horizontal vapours will interfere.
Others who work with ordinary alt-azimuth stands will find it
best to examine the planet at his western elongations during
the last half of the year, when he may be found soon after
rising by the naked eye or with an opera-glass, and retained
in the telescope for several hours after sunrise if necessary.
He may sometimes also be brought into the field before sunset
(at the eastern elongations in the spring months), by careful
sweeping with a comet-eyepiece, especially when either the
Moon, Venus, or Jupiter happens to be near, and the observer
has found the relative place of the planet from an ephemeris.</p>

<p><i>Schiaparelli’s Results.</i>—Mercury was displayed under several
advantages in the morning twilight of November 1882, and I
made a series of observations with a 10-inch reflector, power
212. Several dark markings were perceived, and a conspicuous
white spot. The general appearance of the disk was
similar to that of Mars, and I forwarded a summary of my
results to Prof. Schiaparelli, of Milan, who favoured me with
the following interesting reply:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>
<p>“I have myself been occupied with this planet during the
past year (1882). You are right in saying that Mercury is
much easier to observe than Venus, and that his aspect
resembles Mars more than any other of the planets of the
solar system. It has some spots which become partially
obscured and sometimes completely so; it has also some
brilliant white spots in a variable position. As I observe the
planet entirely by day and near the meridian I have been able
to see its spots many times, but not always with the necessary
distinctness to make drawings sufficiently reliable to serve as
a base for a rigorous investigation. It is remarkable that
the views taken near superior conjunction have been more
instructive for me than those taken when the disk is near
dichotomy, the defect in diameter being compensated by the
possibility of seeing nearly all the disk, which, under those
conditions, is more strongly illuminated. I believe that by
instrumental means, such as our 8½-inch refractor at Milan
gives, it is possible to prove the rotation-period of Mercury
and to gain a knowledge of the principal spots as regards the
generality of their forms. But these spots are really very
complicated, for, besides the difficulties attending their observation,
they are extremely variable.”</p>

<p>Prof. Schiaparelli used an 8½-inch refractor in this work,
and was able, under some favourable conditions, to apply a
power of 400. The outcome of his researches, encouraged
since 1882 by the addition of an 18-inch refractor to the
appliances of his Observatory, has been recently announced in
the curious fact that the rotation of Mercury is performed in
the same time that the planet revolves round the Sun! If
this conclusion is just, Mercury constantly presents one and
the same hemisphere to the Sun, and the behaviour of the
Moon relatively to the Earth has found an analogy. But
these deductions of the eminent Italian astronomer require
corroboration, and this is not likely to be soon forthcoming
owing to the obstacles which stand in the way.</p>

<p><i>Observations of Schröter and Sir W. Herschel.</i>—Schröter
observed Mercury with characteristic diligence between 1780
and 1815. In 1800 he several times remarked that the
southern horn of the crescent was blunted, and fixed the
planet’s rotation-period at 24<sup>h</sup> 4<sup>m</sup>. He also inferred the
existence of a mountain 12 miles in height. But elements of
doubt are attached to some of Schröter’s observations; and
Sir W. Herschel, whose telescopic surveys of both Mercury
and Venus were singularly barren of interesting results,
pointed out their improbability. But the great observer of
Slough was not very amicably disposed towards his rival in
Germany. His strictures appear, however, to have been not
without justice if we consider them in the light of modern
observations.</p>

<p><i>Surface-markings.</i>—Spots or markings of any kind have
rarely been distinguished on Mercury. On June 11, 1867,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
Prince recorded a bright spot, with faint lines diverging from
it N.E. and S. The spot was a little S. of the centre. Birmingham,
on March 13, 1870, glimpsed a large white spot near
the planet’s E. limb, and Vögel, at Bothkamp, observed spots
on April 14 and 22, 1871. These instances are quoted by
Webb, and they, in combination with the markings seen by
Schiaparelli at Milan and by the author at Bristol in 1882,
sufficiently attest that this object deserves more attentive
study.</p>

<p>Amateurs with moderately large instruments would be
usefully employed in following this planet at the most
opportune periods and making careful drawings under the
highest powers that can be successfully applied. Mercury
has been persistently neglected by many in past years, and no
doubt this “swift-winged messenger of the Gods” has eluded
some of his would-be pursuers; but there is every prospect that
a patient observer, careful to utilize all available opportunities,
would soon gather some profitable data relating to his
appearance.</p>

<p><i>Transits of Mercury.</i>—One of the most interesting phenomena,
albeit a somewhat rare event, in connection with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Mercury, is that of a transit across the Sun. The planet then
appears as a black circular spot. Observers have noticed one
or two very small luminous points on the black disk, and an
annulus has been visible round it. These features are probably
optical effects, and it will be worth while to remember
them on the occasion of future transits, of which the subjoined
is a list:—</p>


<ul><li>1891, May 9.</li>
<li>1894, Nov. 10.</li>
<li>1907, Nov. 12.</li>
<li>1914, Nov. 6.</li>

<li>1960, Nov. 6.</li>
<li>1970, May 9.</li>
<li>1973, Nov. 9.</li></ul>


<p>The first observer of a transit of Mercury appears to have
been Gassendi, at Paris, on Nov. 7, 1631.</p>

<p><i>Occultations of Mercury.</i>—There was an occultation of
Mercury by the Moon on April 25, 1838. It occurred on
the day of the planet’s greatest elongation E., and at a
time in the evening when it might have been most suitably
witnessed, but cloudy skies appear to have frustrated the
hopes of intending observers. There was a repetition of
the event on the morning of May 2, 1867, and it occurred,
curiously enough, less than 24 hours after an occultation
of Venus.</p>

<p><i>Beauty of Venus.</i>—This planet has an expressive name, and it
naturally leads us to expect that the object to which it is applied
is a beautiful one. The observer will not be disappointed in this
anticipation: he will find Venus the most attractive planet of
our system. No such difficulties are encountered in finding
Venus as in detecting Mercury; for the former recedes to a
distance of 47° from the Sun, and sometimes remains visible
4½ hours after sunset, as in February 1889. But Venus owes
her beauty not so much to favourable position as to surpassing
lustre. None of the other planets can compare with her in
respect to brilliancy. The giant planet Jupiter is pale beside
her, and offers no parallel. Ruddy Mars looks faint in her
presence, and does not assume to rivalry.</p>

<p>This planet alternately adorns the morning and evening
sky, as she reaches her W. and E. elongations from the Sun.
The ancients styled her <i>Lucifer</i> (“the harbinger of day”)
when a morning star and <i>Hesperus</i> when an evening star.</p>

<p><i>Brilliancy.</i>—Her brightness is such as to lead her to
occasionally become a conspicuous object to the naked eye in
daytime, and at night she casts a perceptible shadow. This is
specially the case near the epoch of her maximum brilliancy,
which is attained when the planet is in a crescent form, with
an apparent diameter of about 40″, and situated some 5 weeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
from inferior conjunction. Though only a fourth part of the
disk is then illuminated, it emits more lustre than a greater
phase, because the latter occurs at a wider distance from the
Earth and when the diameter is much less. Her appearance
is sometimes so striking that it is not to be wondered at that
people, not well informed as to celestial events, have attributed
it to causes of unusual nature. When the planet was visible
as a morning star in the autumn of 1887, an idea became
prevalent in the popular mind that the “Star of Bethlehem”
had returned, and there were many persons who submitted to
the inconvenience of rising before daylight to gaze upon a
spectacle of such phenomenal import. And they were not
disappointed in the expectancy of beholding a star of extreme
beauty, though altogether wrong in surrounding it with a
halo of mystery and wonder.</p>

<p>At intervals of eight years the elongations of Venus
are repeated on nearly the same dates as before, and the
planet is presented under very similar conditions. This is
because five synodical periods (nearly = 13 sidereal periods)
of Venus are equal to eight terrestrial years. Thus very
favourable E. elongations occurred on May 9, 1860, May 7,
1868, May 5, 1876, and May 2, 1884; and on April 30, 1892,
there will be a similar elongation.</p>

<p><i>Period &amp;c.</i>—Venus moves round the Sun in an orbit
of slight eccentricity, and completes a revolution in
224<sup>d</sup> 16<sup>h</sup> 49<sup>m</sup> 8<sup>s</sup>. Her mean distance from that luminary
is 67,000,000 miles. The apparent diameter of the planet
varies from 9″·5 at superior to 65″ at inferior conjunction,
and it averages 25″ at elongations. Her real diameter is
7500 miles. The polar compression is very slight—in fact,
not sufficiently decided for measurement; this is also true of
Mercury.</p>

<p><i>Venus as a Telescopic Object.</i>—When the telescope is
directed to Venus it must be admitted that the result hardly
justifies the anticipation. Observers are led to believe, from
the beauty of her aspect as viewed with the unaided eye, that
instrumental power will greatly enhance the picture and
reveal more striking appearances than are displayed on less
conspicuous planets. But the hope is illusive. The lustre of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Venus is so strong at night that her disk is rarely defined with
satisfactory clearness; there is generally a large amount of
glare surrounding it, and our instruments undergo a severe
ordeal when their capacities are tested upon this planet.
Observations should be undertaken in the daytime, or near
the times of sunrise or sunset, when the refulgence of this
object does not exert itself in extreme degree. But putting
aside the question of definition for the moment, there are other
circumstances which conspire to render the view a somewhat
unattractive one. There are no dark spots, of bold outline,
such as we may plainly discern on Mars, visible on her
surface. There is no wonderful arrangement of luminous
rings, such as encircle Saturn. There are no signs of dark
variegated belts, similar to those which gird both Jupiter and
Saturn; nor is there any system of attendant satellites, such
as accompany each of the superior planets. But though
Venus is wanting in these respects, she may yet boast an
attraction which the outer planets can never display to us,
namely, the beautiful crescented phase, which, tradition says,
was predicted by Copernicus, and, when afterwards observed
in Galilei’s telescope, justly considered a convincing fact in
support of the Copernican system. The phases are best seen
in strong twilight, whenever Venus is favourably situated.
It has been asserted that the crescent of this planet has been
distinguished with the naked eye; but the statement is
undoubtedly erroneous. Any small glass will show it, however,
as it is sometimes well visible when subtending an
angle of 50″ or 55″.</p>

<p><i>Surface-markings.</i>—In 1666 and the following year J. D.
Cassini observed several bright spots on Venus and also two
obscure markings; but the latter were extremely faint and of
irregular extent, so that little could be gleaned from them. He
watched these forms closely and remarked certain changes in
their positions, which finally enabled him to determine the
period of the planet’s rotation. In 1726 and 1727 Bianchini,
at Rome, repeatedly observed dark spots, and their outlines
seem to have been so consistent that he depicted them on a
chart and gave them names. But J. Cassini, at Paris, failed
to confirm these results, though he used telescopes of 82-and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
114-feet focus; and it was supposed the climate of Paris was
not suitable for such delicate observations. Schröter reviewed
this planet in 1788 and later years, and succeeded in
detecting various markings and irregularities in the terminator
and cusps. He announced that he had seen the S. horn of
the crescent truncated, so that a bright point was apparently
isolated at its extremity. From this he concluded there must
be mountains of great altitude on the planet, and the perpendicular
height of one of these he computed at 22 miles, which
is four times the height of the most lofty mountain on the
Earth. If the surface of Venus were uniformly level, then
her cusps would taper gradually away to points, and no such
deformation as that described by Schröter could possibly be
produced. And there is strong negative evidence among
modern observations as to the existence of abnormal features;
so that the presence of very elevated mountains must be
regarded as extremely doubtful, if, indeed, the theory has not
to be entirely abandoned. The detached point at the S. horn
shown in Schröter’s telescope was probably a false appearance
due to atmospheric disturbances or instrumental defects.
Whenever the seeing is indifferent, this planet assumes some
treacherous features which are very apt to deceive the
observer, especially if his telescope is faulty. Spurious
details are seen, which quite disappear from the sharp images
obtained in steadier air with a good glass. I have never
observed truncation in either of the horns of Venus; but on
certain occasions, when the planet has been ill-defined in
passing vapours, it was most easy to believe that a fragment
became detached from the extremity of the cusp, just in the
manner described by Schröter. But close attention has
showed the effect to be false, and revealed its cause. It was
the rippling of the image that gave rise to the apparently
dissevered cusp, in the same way that passing air-waves and
resulting quivers in the image of Saturn’s ring will sometimes
produce displacements, so that the observer momentarily sees
several black divisions, and the edges are multiplied and superimposed
one on another. Refraction, exercised by heated
vapours in crossing objects, is obviously the source of all
this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>Sir W. Herschel frequently examined this planet between
1777 and 1793, but could not discern spots sufficiently
definite and durable to enable him to fix the time of rotation.
He dissented from Schröter as to the alleged mountains, and
said, “No eye which is not considerably better than mine, or
assisted by much better telescopes, will ever get a sight of
them.”</p>

<p>Mädler effected some observations of this planet in 1833
and some subsequent years. He detected spots on two
occasions only, but noticed irregularities in the terminator
and cusps. Di Vico and others at Rome, in 1840-1, devoted
much attention to this object, and secured a large number of
observations. They appear to have recovered the spots
charted by Bianchini, and described them as of the last
degree of faintness. The observers who saw the spots most
readily were those who had the most difficulty in detecting
the faint companion of a close double star. In the spring of
1841 Di Vico saw a marking on the northern cusp involved
in an oval luminosity, and he likened it to a crater on the
Moon viewed obliquely. This spot had a diameter of at least
4½″, and it was seen to advance even into the obscure part of
the disk.</p>

<p>Schiaparelli has recently discussed a large number of
observations of this planet, and concludes that, like Mercury,
she rotates on her axis in the same time that she completes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
sidereal revolution round the Sun, viz. in 224·7 days! I
merely mention this remarkable deduction, without quoting
any facts in opposition to it.</p>

<p>From observations by Perrotin at Nice in 1890, including
74 observations, the rotation of this planet is very slow, and
is made in such a way that the relative positions of the spots
and terminator do not experience any notable change during
many days.</p>

Venus as an evening star. (10-inch Reflector; power 212.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Faintness of the Markings.</i>—Several observers have noticed
a slight blunting of the S. horn of Venus, and in recent years
dusky spots have not unfrequently been seen, notably by
Buffham, Langdon, and others. The only markings distinguishable
with my 10-inch reflector are faint grey areas,
without definite boundaries. These are sometimes so delicate
that it is difficult to assign exact form and position to them,
and occasionally I have regarded their very existence as
of doubtful character. They appear to be mere inequalities in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
brightness of the surface, and may be due to different reflective
power in parts of the dense atmosphere of this planet. Certainly
the spots are nothing like those seen on the disks
of Mars and Jupiter, many of which are extremely distinct
and show sharply terminated outlines. Dawes, an observer
endowed with very keen sight, could never succeed in finding
any markings on Venus, and many others have failed. But
the evidence affirming their reality is too weighty and too
numerously attested to allow them to be set aside. Occasionally
the disk appears speckled with minute shadings, and
some observers have noticed crateriform objects near the
terminator; but these are uncertain. Brilliant spots have
also been recorded quite recently at the cusps.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be advisable here to add a word of caution
to observers not to be hastily drawn to believe the spots are
visible in very small glasses. Accounts are sometimes published
of very dark and definite markings seen with only 2 or
3 inches aperture. Such assertions are usually unreliable.
Could the authors of such statements survey the planet through
a good 10-or 12-inch telescope, they would see at once they
had been deceived. Some years ago I made a number of
observations of Venus with 2-, 3-, and 4-1/4-inch refractors and
4-and 10-inch reflectors, and could readily detect with the
small instruments what certainly appeared to be spots of a
pronounced nature, but on appealing to the 10-inch reflector,
in which the view became immensely improved, the spots
quite disappeared, and there remained scarcely more than a
suspicion of the faint condensations which usually constitute
the only visible markings on the surface. I believe, also, the
serrated terminator is not a real feature of the object, but
rather an effect either of the rippling contour of the image
or of an imperfect or inadequate telescope.</p>

<p>An atmosphere of considerable density probably surrounds
this planet, for at the limb the brightness of the disk is much
intensified. A medium like this, that reflects and refracts
light in extreme degree, is brighter under oblique vision, as
at the limb of Venus.</p>

<p><i>Twilight on Venus.</i>—When Venus is a slender crescent,
near inferior conjunction, a feeble luminosity pervades the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
dark part of the disk similar to the “ashy light” or earthshine
observed on the crescented Moon. On such occasions
the unilluminated surface appears to be involved in a phosphorescence.
Several observers have, however, described the
unilluminated limb of Venus as darker than the background
of sky. Zenger, at Prague, has noticed a brownish-red ring
surrounding the planet, and he attributes the appearance to
much the same cause as that which occasions the coppery
colour of the Moon in a total eclipse.</p>

<p><i>Alleged Satellite.</i>—Cassini, Short, Montaigne, and others,
in the 17th and 18th centuries, observed small crescents near
Venus and inferred the existence of a satellite; but no such
object has presented itself in more recent times. It is
extremely probable that the observers were mistaken. In
some cases the duplicate image may have been formed by
reflection in the eyepiece; in others a small star or planet
situated near Venus gave rise to the deception. M. Stroobant
has fully investigated this astronomical myth, and disposed of
many of the observations, without having recourse to the
apocryphal satellite named “Neith” by M. Niesten, who has
discussed the question from an affirmative point of view.</p>

<p><i>Further Observations required.</i>—From the foregoing summary
amateurs will notice that several difficult and more
or less evanescent features on this brilliant member of our
system stand in need of confirmation. Certain disputed
forms require also to be looked for. The faint dusky patches,
the bright spots at the horns, and the inequalities in the
curve of the terminator will sure to be re-observed in future
years; and it is necessary that such details should be precisely
noted in regard to their positions and outlines as often as
possible. A series of reliable observations of this character
might enable a fresh value of the rotation-period to be deduced
from them; and this is desirable, for though Cassini, Schröter,
and Di Vico give periods which are in close harmony, there
are elements of uncertainty attached to their results. A new
determination of the period would be valuable, and especially
so if based on really trustworthy data obtained by one of the
best modern telescopes. With the planet situated near inferior
conjunction, the crescent (reduced at such a time to a mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
thread of light) should be brought into the field, and the
observer should look for the extension of a faint glow over the
interior parts of the surface, and make comparisons between
the relative brightness of the planet’s dark limb and of the
sky on which it is projected. The telescopic images of Venus
are often excellent in daylight, and those who possess means
of readily finding the planet at such times will be very likely
to gain some useful materials. As to the presumed satellite,
that may be relegated to the care of observers who have the
leisure and inclination to pursue an <i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i>; but should
any doubtful object appear in the field with Venus at any
time, it ought to be fully recorded and identified, if possible.</p>

<p><i>Transits of Venus.</i>—Those who were prevented by circumstances
of weather or otherwise from witnessing either of the
transits of Venus which occurred in 1874 and 1882 lost a
spectacle of great rarity, and one which they can never have
another chance to behold. The next transit occurs in the year
2004, and its phenomena will doubtless be watched with avidity
by the astronomers of a future generation. The transit of
1882 was seen by many observers in England, though in some
parts of the country the Sun was obscured by clouds. The
planet was distinctly visible to the naked eye as a black
circular spot in gradual motion across the solar disk. The
most important result of the telescopic observations was of
course the re-determination of the Sun’s distance; but
amongst the physical features noted, one of the most interesting
was the appearance of a silver arc of light on that
portion of the planet’s edge which was outside the Sun.
This is assumed to have been caused by the refraction of an
atmosphere on Venus. The phenomenon was seen by several
observers, including Prof. Langley in America and Messrs.
Prince and Brodie in England.</p>

<p><i>Occultations of Venus.</i>—An occupation of this planet by
the Moon appears to have been recorded by the Chinese on
March 19, 361 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> Tycho Brahe witnessed a similar phenomenon
on May 23, 1587. Mœstlin observed Venus occult
Regulus on Sept. 16, 1574; and on Oct. 2, 1590, this planet
appears to have passed over Mars. Visible occultations of
Venus are somewhat rare; they usually occur in daylight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
A phenomenon of this kind was witnessed on Dec. 8, 1877,
over all the W. part of the United States; and Prof. Pritchett,
of Missouri, says:—“The interest taken in it was shared alike
by the educated and the illiterate, and even by children.” The
evening was cloudless, and many persons noted the time of
disappearance of Venus as seen by the unassisted eye. With
a 12½-inch refractor, power 275, Prof. Pritchett noted that
“when the bright limb of Venus was within 8″ or 10″ of the
Moon’s dark limb, a border of wavering light, several seconds
in width, seemed to precede the planet. Its general effect
was such as to place in doubt the moment of external contact.”
A full description of this event, and of the partial occultation
of Venus on Oct. 12, 1879, is given in No. 1 of the ‘Publications’
of the Morrison Observatory, Missouri, U.S.A.</p>

<p>Venus is said, by the Arabian astronomer Ibn-Jounis, to
have occulted Regulus on Sept. 9, 885 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>; and Hind has
examined the observations, by means of Le Verrier’s tables of
the Sun and planets. He finds that on Sept. 9 in the year
mentioned, at 16h 43m mean time, Venus approached the
star within 1´·7; so that to the naked eye the latter would
appear to be occulted, being overpowered in the glare of the
planet.</p>

<p><i>Appearance of the Planet.</i>—Mars is the fourth planet in the
order of distance from the Sun. He revolves in an orbit
outside that of the Earth, and is the smallest of the superior
planets. His brilliancy is sometimes considerable when he
occupies a position near to the Earth, and he emits an intense
red light<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>, which renders his appearance all the more striking.
Ordinarily his lustre does not equal that of Jupiter, though
when favourably placed he becomes a worthy rival of that
orb. In 1719 he shone so brightly and with such a fiery
aspect as to cause a panic. The superstitious notions and
belief in astrological influences prevailing at that time no
doubt gave rise to the popular apprehension that the ruddy
star was an omen of disaster, and thus it was regarded with
feelings of terror. Fortunately the light of science has long
since removed such ideas from amongst us, and celestial
objects, in all their various forms, are contemplated without
misgiving. They are rather welcomed as affording the means
of advancing our knowledge of God’s wonderful works as
displayed in the heavens.</p>

<p><i>Period &amp;c.</i>—Mars revolves round the Sun in 686<sup>d</sup> 23<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup> 41<sup>s</sup>,
and his mean distance from that luminary is 141,500,000 miles.
The orbit is one of considerable eccentricity, the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
varying between 154,700,000 and 128,360,000 miles. The
apparent diameter of the planet when in conjunction with the
Sun is only 4″; but this may augment to 30″·4 at an opposition,
when the Earth and Mars occupy the least distant
parts of their orbits. The real diameter of Mars is nearly
5000 miles.</p>

<p><i>Phase.</i>—At opposition the disk of Mars is round, but when
in quadrature he appears distinctly gibbous and resembles the
Moon three days from full. The phase is so palpable that
Galilei glimpsed it at the end of 1610. In delineations of
Mars the disk is generally drawn circular, the compression
being very slight and the phase too trivial to be regarded.</p>

<p><i>Surface Configuration.</i>—This planet being singularly variable
in his position relatively to the Earth, presents at times
a diameter so small that the most powerful instruments are
ineffective to deal with him. But at certain epochs he becomes
an excellent object, with a much expanded disk, on which are
displayed a number of bright and dark markings. This
happens, however, with comparative rarity; for only during
two months or so near every opposition, occurring at intervals
of 780 days, can the planet be well seen. Generally the
apparent size of Mars is very inconsiderable, and the disk not
sharply defined, especially when the altitude is low. Reliable
observations are seldom made at a time far removed from the
date of opposition. When the planet was badly placed, in
July 1882, an observer secured some observations of position,,
and published them, thinking he had seen Wells’s Comet,
which happened to be in the same quarter of the sky!</p>

<p>Mars, in nearer degree than any other member of our
system, shows a configuration which may be likened to that
of the Earth as regards its permanency; and in some of its
outlines a general resemblance also exists, though in detail
there is evidently much that is dissimilar. It is fortunate that
the atmosphere of Mars is so rarefied that observers can look
upon his real surface-lineaments with satisfactory perspicuity.
For more than 250 years now, the telescope has been engaged
in perfecting our knowledge of Martian features, and these
have exhibited no mobility of form or place (apart from that
due to rotation or varying inclination of the planet) so far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
may be judged from a comparison of drawings. Plenty of
differences exist in the latter, it is true, though similar objects
are represented; but the explanation obviously lies in the
inaccuracies of amateur artists, and has little if anything to do
with physical changes on the planet.</p>

<p>When the spots were discovered in 1636 by Fontana
they were, of course, very dimly glimpsed in the incompetent
appliances available at that time. Huygens, in 1659, saw
them better by means of his long telescopes, but still very
imperfectly. Cassini, in 1666, effected a further advance in
the same field, and gathered data from which he was able to
announce the period of rotation. His value has proved
remarkably correct, considering the means he employed to
obtain it and the very short interval over which his inquiries
were conducted. Huygens had previously, in 1659, witnessed
the returns of a certain spot to the same approximate
place on the planet, and was led to infer rotation in either
12<sup>h</sup> or 24<sup>h</sup>. But this was little better than a guess, and not
nearly of the same precision as that which marked Cassini’s
subsequent determination.</p>

</div>

<p>Near the poles of Mars are intensely bright patches, which
have been considered to be vast areas of snow-crowned surface
or fields of ice. These “polar snows” are not situated exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
at the poles, nor are they opposite to each other. Changes
affect their aspect. Occasionally these or other bright
markings, when on the limb, appear to protrude beyond
the disk, and this curious effect of irradiation distorts the
limb in a striking manner.</p>

<p><i>Charts and Nomenclature of Mars.</i>—It is not desirable to
trace with any detail the successive labours of those who have
chiefly contributed to our knowledge of areographic features.
Maraldi, W. Herschel, Schröter, Mädler, Schmidt, and Dawes
were foremost amongst the observers of the past; while
Schiaparelli and Green are the most successful observers
of to-day. As telescopes improved in effectiveness the true
forms and characteristics of the markings were discerned, and
at the present time some thousands of delineations of this
planet must be in existence. Charts of the leading and best-assured
features have been formed, and the regions of light
and shade (supposed to represent land and sea) have received
proper names to distinguish them. Thus there is “Fontana
Land,” “Maraldi Sea,” “Herschel Continent,” and others of
similar import. Schiaparelli has framed a chart in which the
spots are furnished with Latin names taken from classical
geography. Mädler’s plan was to designate the markings by
capital letters of the alphabet, and to divide these by small
letters in necessary cases. But the charts of Proctor, Green,
and others, in which the names of past and present astronomers
are applied, seem to find most favour, though it is
admitted that this method of nomenclature is not free from
objections. In some instances the names have not been wisely
selected. A few years ago, when christening celestial formations
was more in fashion than it is now, a man simply had
to use a telescope for an evening or two on Mars or the Moon,
and spice the relation of his seeings with something in the way
of novelty, when his name would be pretty certainly attached
to an object and hung in the heavens for all time! A writer
in the ‘Astronomical Register’ for January 1879 humorously
suggested that “the matter should be put into the hands of an
advertizing agent” and “made the means of raising a revenue
for astronomical purposes.” Some men would not object to
pay handsomely for the distinction of having their names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
applied to the seas and continents of Mars or to the craters
on the Moon. But it is all very well to disparage a system:
can a better one be found? Probably not; but the lavish
use of undeserving names is calculated to bring any system
into contempt.</p>

<div class="caption">Orbits of the Satellites of Mars.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Discovery of Satellites and of Canal-shaped markings.</i>—The
interest in this planet has been accentuated in recent years by
several circumstances. The discovery of two satellites in 1877
by Prof. Hall, with the 25·8-inch Washington refractor, caused
the directors of large instruments to test their capacity upon
these minute objects. Schiaparelli’s observations of the canal-shaped
markings have afforded another attractive feature in
connection with this planet. He detected a network of dark
straight lines stretching generally from N. to S. across the
planet; and in the winter of 1881 found these objects duplicated,
<i>i. e.</i> the lines ran in pairs so close together that they
were separated with difficulty. The study of the topography
of Mars had never previously revealed structures like these;
yet the Italian astronomer appears to have observed them
with “comparative ease whenever the air was still.” Other
observers have not wholly confirmed the appearances alluded
to, but no favourable opposition has occurred since 1877, and
no surprise need be felt that the delicate features visible in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
pellucid sky of Italy should elude detection in less genial
climes. In 1886 M. Perrotin, at Nice, using a 15-inch equatoreal,
saw a number of the “canals,” and some of them were
double. In 1888 the observers having charge of the 36-inch
refractor at Mount Hamilton re-observed the “canals” as
broad bands, but none of them appeared to be duplicated.
The conditions were unfavourable, the planet being more than
three months past opposition.</p>

<p>Prof. Schiaparelli re-observed the duple “canals” in June
1890 with a refractor by Merz of 18 inches aperture, powers
350 and 500. His observations are supported by Mr. A. S.
Williams, of Brighton, who informs me that he detected
forty-three of the “canals,” and seven of them were “clearly
and certainly seen to be double.” Mr. Williams’s instrument
is a 6½-inch reflector by Calver, and powers of 320 and 430
were successfully employed on it; magnifiers under 300 were
found of little use.</p>

<p><i>Summary of Observations.</i>—From observations at Bristol I
have drawn up the following summary as to the configuration
of Mars:—</p>

<p>1. That the “Hour-glass” or “Kaiser Sea,” and some
other markings of analogous character, present very bold, dark,
and clearly defined outlines, enabling them to be visible in
very small telescopes. In 1873 I saw certain spots with a
refractor of only 1-3/4-inch aperture. Mr. Grover, in 1867,
“made a set of pencil-drawings, with a 2-inch telescope,
which gave the general markings of the planet very well.”
In ‘Recreative Science’ it is mentioned that on June 7,
1860, a semi-circular dark spot on the N.W. part of the
disk of Mars was distinctly seen with a 1½-inch telescope,
power 120.</p>

<p>2. There is an intricate mass of surface-markings on the
planet, which, in its main features, is capable of being satisfactorily
delineated, and which in its general aspect is similar
to the canals depicted by Schiaparelli, though not nearly so
pronounced, straight, and uniform as he has shown in his
charts.</p>

<p>3. The detail is visible in the form of irregular streaks,
condensations, and veins of shading, very faint and delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
in some parts. The veins apparently connect many of the
larger spots, and here and there show condensations, which
have sometimes been drawn as isolated spots. A night of
good definition, however, reveals the feeble ligaments of
shade connecting them.</p>

<p>4. That there exists on the immediate borders of many of
the darker patches and veins a remarkable brightness or
shimmering, which reminds one of the bright spots merging
out of the dark belts on Jupiter. Just contiguous to the
“Kaiser Sea,” and on its eastern limits, this brightness was
so striking in March 1886 as to compare with that exhibited
by the N. polar cap. In drawings by many observers these
regions of special luminosity have no place, but there is little
doubt they occupy a leading position in the physical configuration
of Mars.</p>

<p>5. That there is no trace of a dense atmosphere on Mars,
as some of the text-books infer. The pronounced aspect of
the chief markings, their durableness and continuity of form,
the ease with which they may be traced up to the limb,
the absence of phenomena indicating dense cloud-bearing
air-strata, and other observed facts verify the conclusion
that the planet’s surface is comparatively free of vapours,
and in a totally different condition to that of Jupiter and
Saturn.</p>

<p><i>Rotation of Mars.</i>—The diurnal period of this planet is
known with far greater certainty and precision than that of
any other planet, the Earth excepted. It will be useful
to quote the values derived since Cassini’s time:—</p>

<p>The last of these, by Prof. Bakhuyzen of Leyden, is probably
the best. It was based on a large number of observations
extending over 220 years, viz. from those of Huygens
in 1659 to those of Schiaparelli in 1879.</p>

<p>In a terrestrial day Mars rotates through 350°·8922,
according to Mr. Marth’s period. In one hour the axial
motion is 14°·6, whereas on Jupiter the horary rate of
rotation is 36°·7. At intervals of 40 days (during which
Mars completes 39 rotations) the various features on the
disk are presented at very nearly the same times as before.
Mr. Marth’s ephemerides of this planet are extremely useful
to those who study the markings; and these, in combination
with the charts and memoirs of Schiaparelli, Green, Terby,
and others, greatly facilitate and encourage the renewed
study of this object.</p>

<p><i>Further Observations required.</i>—Favourable oppositions of
Mars occur every 15 years, as in 1877 and 1892. It is at
such periods that this planet should be sedulously interrogated
for new features, or for corroboration of those already known.
Rather a high power must be employed—certainly more
than 200; and if the telescope has an aperture of at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
8 inches, the observer will be sure to discern a considerable
extent of detail. He should compare his views with the
various charts previously alluded to, and note any inconsistencies.
Fresh drawings should also be made; and if
the forms are not well assured on one night, he may confirm
them by coming 37 minutes later to his instrument on the
following night. Or the collective issue of several nights’
work may be included in the same drawing. The bright
spots on the planet should be as attentively studied as the
darker regions, and given a place in every drawing; for it is
probably in connection with these luminous objects that
active changes may be recognized. The “canals” and their
duplication form the principal markings to be looked for;
though the successful elucidation of these appearances can
only be expected in a case where a powerful telescope, a
keen eye, and a good atmosphere operate together. Something
of them may be seen under ordinary conditions, and
they ought to be very generally sought for by amateurs; for
it is not always that success is found where the best conditions
prevail. The great telescopes at Mount Hamilton, Nice, and
other observatories may be expected to command some
advantages of light, power, and position; but this need not
prevent competition, or induce the idea that common appliances
are practically of no avail. Everyone should strive to achieve
as much as is consistent with his means and opportunities;
indeed there is all the more need for effort and energy in the
observer when his tools are seemingly inadequate to a research,
and he should endeavour to find, in his own eye and understanding,
that power which shall compensate in a great
measure for lack of instrumental capacity. Mr. Proctor, in
his ‘Old and New Astronomy,’ has justly remarked:—“The
directors of Government observatories have usually been much
less successful in studying planetary details than those zealous
amateurs who take delight in the study of the heavenly orbs
and are ready to wait and watch for favourable opportunities.”</p>

<p><i>Changes on Mars.</i>—Changes have been confidently reported
in some of the Martian spots. Instances have been quoted in
which particular markings, though very plain at certain times,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
have scarcely been perceptible at others. Variations in outline
as well as in visibility appear to have been witnessed, and
the subject is one which merits more extended notice. It has
been asserted that the origin of such variations probably lies
in the aerial envelope of Mars. In April and May 1888
M. Perrotin, with the great refractor at Nice, failed to
re-observe the feature known as the continent “Libya” on
Schiaparelli’s chart, and stated that though this formation
was plainly visible in 1886, it had ceased to exist in 1888.
He suggested that the obscuration was really produced by
clouds or mists circulating in the atmosphere of Mars. But
Prof. Holden reported, from the Lick Observatory, that the
object alluded to was distinctly visible with the 36-inch
refractor there at the end of July, and in the same form
in which it was drawn by Prof. Schiaparelli in 1877-8. It
is to be assumed, therefore, that if any change occurred
it was one of transient nature.</p>

<p>There are other questions relating to the physical aspect of
this planet which future observers should be able to answer.
Do the markings retain their distinctness right up to the
limb? Is the opaque crescent of the disk (when Mars is in
quadrature) involved in any phosphorescence or glow indicating
an atmosphere? Are the bright spots and luminous
borders to the continents equally as stable as the dark spots,
and do they maintain an equable brilliancy?</p>

<p>The N. hemisphere of Mars needs much further study, as it
is not so familiarly known as the S. hemisphere. This is
due to the circumstance that, at favourable oppositions, the
region of the S. pole is suitably presented for observation.
It is only when the planet is comparatively distant, and small
in diameter, that his N. hemisphere comes into view.</p>

<p>The difference of inclination under which the features are
seen at successive oppositions gives rise to many apparent
changes of figure. When the S. hemisphere is exposed to
the Earth numerous objects are seen which are quite invisible
when the opposite hemisphere is displayed to us. These
altering conditions have to be considered in their influences
by every student of areography.</p>

<p><i>Satellites of Mars.</i>—After evading the keen and searching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
eyes of Sir W. Herschel, and the power of his 40-foot telescope—after
eluding the grasp of Lord Rosse’s 6-foot speculum,
and the frequent scrutiny of Lassell with his 2-and
4-foot mirrors, the two satellites of Mars were ultimately
revealed to Prof. Hall in the 25·8-inch refractor at Washington.
These tiny orbs had been enabled to avoid previous
discovery by their minuteness and by their close proximity to
Mars. Yet as soon as they were known to exist many
observers saw them, and in certain cases success was undoubtedly
attained with comparatively small instruments.
The late Dr. Erck picked up the outermost satellite with a
7-1/3-inch objective, and Mr. Pratt saw it with an 8-1/7-inch
mirror by With. But the effect of this eye-straining may
just possibly, in one or two instances, have drawn the imagination
out of its normal repose. Mr. Pratt’s instrument shows
stars in the group ε Lyræ which are invisible in the great
Washington telescope and in the 36-inch mirror formerly
used by Mr. Common; so that it may well have produced a
spectral satellite of Mars. But the satellites are certainly
within the occasional reach of moderate means; for they
were repeatedly seen with a 9½-inch refractor at the Observatory
of Princeton, U.S.A., in October and November 1879.
They “were decidedly more easy to see than Mimas,” the
innermost satellite of Saturn.</p>

<p>Phobos, the inner satellite, revolves round the planet in
7<sup>h</sup> 39<sup>m</sup>, in an orbit 6000 miles from the centre of Mars. At
max. elongation the satellite is about 12″ distant from its
primary, and its opposition magnitude is 11½. Deimos, the
outer satellite, revolves in 30<sup>h</sup> 18<sup>m</sup>, and its orbit is 15,000
miles distant from Mars. Its elongations extend to 32″, and
its opposition mag. is 13½. These diminutive objects are
probably not more than 10 miles in diameter. They are
obviously too faint for common instruments, nor are they
objects on which ordinary amateurs may occupy themselves
with advantage. Of course it forms a highly interesting
spectacle to glimpse, just for once, it may be, the small bodies
which resisted telescopic power for more than two and a half
centuries; but for really useful observations, large aperture
and means of accurate measurement are required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p><i>Occultations of Mars.</i>—The most ancient account of a
planetary occultation is probably that given by Aristotle, who
refers to a lunar obscuration of Mars that occurred on April 4,
357 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, according to the calculations of Kepler. Another
occultation of Mars appears to have been recorded by the
Chinese on Feb. 14, 69 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Tycho Brahe observed a repetition
of the event on Dec. 30, 1595. Mr. Baily describes a
phenomenon of this kind which occurred on Feb. 18, 1837,
when “the planet appeared of a fine yellow colour both at its
ingress and egress. No projection was observed.” Mr. Snow,
of Ashhurst, saw the occultation of March 12, 1854, and he
states the planet “was of almost precisely the same colour as
the Moon, and he could not help comparing it to a spangle on
the face of the sky. Whilst it was slowly and solemnly
vanishing, it gave for several seconds the notion of its being
the summit of a lunar mountain, but melted gradually away.”
As Mars emersed, “nothing whatever was to be seen of the
two bodies, clinging together, as it were, by threads of light;
nothing of the pear-shaped appearance often recorded as put
on by planets under similar circumstances.” Mr. J. Tebbutt,
of Windsor, N. S. W., watched an occultation of Mars in full
daylight on Aug. 12, 1875, when “the rapid disappearance of
the planet’s disk was an exceedingly interesting phenomenon,
its extinction taking place at a considerable distance from the
Moon’s illuminated disk. The line marked by the Moon’s
dark limb across the disk was well defined.” At the reappearance
clouds were prevalent, and “the planet was
observed as a small projection on the bright limb;” but
he found it difficult to fix the exact time of last contact,
owing to the ill-defined character of the planet’s gibbous
limb. An occultation of Mars was also seen by Prof. Grant
at Glasgow on June 3, 1878.</p>

<small><i>THE PLANETOIDS.</i></small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Number.—History of their Discovery.—Dimensions and Brightness.—Occultation
of Vesta.</p></blockquote>


<p><i>Number.</i>—These bodies, also called minor planets, and, formerly,
asteroids, comprise a very numerous class, and they are
extremely small, being quite invisible to the naked eye except
in one or two special cases. They all revolve in orbits situated
between Mars and Jupiter. The total number discovered is
about 300, of which Prof. J. Palisa of Vienna has found more
than 70, and the late Dr. C. H. F. Peters of Clinton, N.Y., 49.
I have not given exact numbers in the two former cases,
because these discoveries are still rapidly progressing.</p>

<p><i>History of their Discovery.</i>—The first known planetoid
(Ceres) was sighted by Piazzi on Jan. 1, 1801. The
following year, on March 28, Olbers found another (Pallas).
In 1804, on Sept. 1, Harding discovered a third (Juno);
and in 1807, March 29, Olbers was a second time successful
(Vesta). Then for thirty-eight years no additions were made
to the number. The host of planetoids circulating between
Mars and Jupiter preserved their incognito without disturbance
from the prying and wakeful eyes of astronomers.</p>

<p>But in 1845 Hencke, of Driessen, after years of watching,
at length broke the spell of tranquillity by finding another
small planet; and his example was emulated by many other
observers in subsequent years. Hind, De Gasparis, and Goldschmidt
were amongst the earliest and most successful of those
who gathered new planets from amongst the stars of the
zodiacal constellations. In later years Luther, Watson, and
Borrelly further extended the list; but Palisa and Peters have
distanced all competitors, and shown a zeal in the work which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
has yielded an astonishing aggregate of discoveries. Charlois,
at Nice, has latterly earned distinction in the same field.</p>

<p>Since 1845 new planetoids have been found at the rate of
more than six per annum, and a rich harvest yet remains to
be gathered by the planet-seekers of the future. A very
large proportion of those already detected are between the
tenth and twelfth magnitudes, and are therefore only to
be discerned in good instruments. They present no distinction
from small star-like points, and are to be identified by
their motions alone. The mythological dictionary has furnished
names for them, and they are numbered in the order
of their discovery as well.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions and Brightness.</i>—Vesta is the largest and
brightest of the group, while Ceres and Pallas rank as
second and third in the same respect. Vesta is about
214 miles in diameter; but the more insignificant members
of this family are probably not more than about 15 or
20 miles in diameter. Pallas has the most inclined orbit
of all, the inclination amounting to 30° 44′; so that its
position is by no means confined to the planet-zone of the
ecliptic. Vesta is sometimes brighter than a 6th mag. star;
while Ceres, Pallas, and Juno vary between about the 7th
and 8th magnitudes, according to their distances from the
Earth. A real variation of light has been assumed to occur,
but this is not fully proved.</p>

<p>In March 1887 Mr. Backhouse, of Sunderland, saw an
apparently new, yellowish-white star near 103 Piscium, and
it was just visible to the naked eye. This proved to be Vesta,
though the identity of the object was not known at first, and
it formed the subject of two Dun Echt circulars.</p>

<p>Formerly, hazy indefinite outlines were attributed to some
of the planetoids; but the appearance probably arose from
instrumental defects.</p>

<p>The search for these bodies is not a work likely to engage
amateurs. Professional observers are best able to grapple
with the difficulties attending this kind of observation, where
large telescopes, means of exact measurement, and ample
data, such as star-charts and ephemerides of the planetoids
previously discovered, are requisite. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> ‘Nautical Almanack’
annually contains ephemerides of Ceres, Pallas, Juno,
and Vesta; and observers wishing to pick up any one of them
may readily ascertain positions by reference to this work.</p>

<p><i>Occultation of Vesta.</i>—An occultation of Vesta occurred on
Dec. 30, 1871, and it was observed by Mr. C. G. Talmage at
Leyton with a 10-inch refractor, power 80. He says the
planet was exceedingly bright right up to the Moon’s limb.</p>

<p>Of all the planets, Jupiter is the most interesting for study
by the amateur. It is true that Saturn forms an exquisite
object, and that his wonderful ring-system is well calculated
to incite admiration as a feature unique in the solar system.
But when the two planets come to be repeatedly observed,
and the charm of first impressions has worn away, the
observer must admit that Jupiter, with his broad disk and
constantly changing markings, affords the materials for prolonged
study and sustained interest. With Saturn the case
is different. His features are apparently quiescent; usually
there are no definite spots upon the belts or rings. There is
a <em>sameness</em> in the telescopic views; and this ultimately leads
to a feeling of monotony, which causes the object to be
neglected in favour of another where active changes are
in visible progress.</p>

<p><i>Brightness and Position.</i>—Jupiter is a brilliant object in the
heavens, his lustre exceeding that of Mars or Saturn, though
not equal to that of Venus. I have occasionally seen the planet
with the naked eye in the daytime, about half an hour after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
sunrise; and it has been frequently observed by Bond, in
America, with the Sun at a considerable altitude. Humboldt
and Bonpland, at Cumana, 10° N. lat., saw Jupiter distinctly
with the naked eye, 18 minutes after the Sun had appeared
in the horizon, on Sept. 26, 1830. The planet is favourably
visible for a considerable time every year, and is only beyond
reach near the times of his conjunctions with the Sun, when
he usually evades observation for about three months. As
regards his altitude, Jupiter becomes exceptionally well
placed at intervals of 12 years; thus in 1859, 1870-1, and
1882 his declination was 22° or 23° N., and his height therefore
very great when passing the meridian. In 1894 he will
occupy a similarly auspicious region to observers in the
N. hemisphere. In 1865, 1877, and 1889 his declination
was 23° S., and he was favourably presented to southern
astronomers.</p>

<p>The image of Jupiter as seen in a telescope is involved in a
slight yellow tinge, and with the naked eye the same colour
is often apparent. But when observed through a very pure
transparent atmosphere, his light nearly approaches the
silvery lustre of Venus or the Moon. The planet shines
with unusual splendour, considering his great distance from
the Sun, and his atmosphere must be highly reflective and
possibly intensified by inherent light from the planet himself.
The central parts of Jupiter’s disk are usually the brightest,
as there is a faint shading-off and indefiniteness at the
limbs. These and other facts support the view that Jupiter
is still incalescent and sufficiently self-luminous to emit a
small amount of light.</p>

<p><i>Period &amp;c.</i>—This planet revolves round the Sun in
4332d 14h 2m, which is equal to more than 11-3/4 years. His
orbit is somewhat eccentric, so that his distance from the Sun
varies from 506,500,000 to 460,000,000 miles, and the mean
is 483,300,000 miles. His apparent diameter ranges from a
max. of 50″ at a good opposition to 30″·4 in conjunction.
The planet’s diameter measured along the equator is 88,000
miles, and the polar compression is very marked, amounting
to 1/16, or, more exactly, to 1/15·82, according to Engelmann, from
a mean derived from eleven observers. When Jupiter is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
quadrature there is a slight phase evident in the shading-off
of the limb furthest from the Sun.</p>

<p><i>Belts and Spots on the Planet.</i>—From the time that the
telescope became available as a means of astronomical research,
it may be readily surmised that an object coming so well
within the reach of ordinary appliances, and one displaying
so many prominent and variable features, should absorb a
large share of attention, and that many facts of interest
should have been gleaned as to his physical peculiarities.
But it must be confessed that, though something has been
learned as to the visible behaviour of the markings, there is
much that is perplexing in their curious vagaries. No doubt
the vast changes affecting the Jovian envelope, the diversity
of the markings, and their proper motions result from the
operations of a peculiarly variable atmosphere, affected
probably by a heated and active globe beneath it, and by the
very rapid movement of rotation to which it is subject.</p>

<p>The telescope, on being turned towards Jupiter, reveals at
once an array of dark and light stripes or belts stretching
across the disk in a direction parallel to one another and to the
equator of the planet. These belts are supposed to have been
first detected by Zucchi in 1630. Usually there are two
broad and prominent dark belts, one on either side of the
equator; while towards the poles other belts appear, some of
them very narrow, partly by the effects of foreshortening.
The equatoreal zone of the planet is of a lighter tint, and
variegated with white and dark spots and streaks, liable to
rapid changes, and indicating that this region is in a highly
disturbed condition.</p>

<p><i>Observations of Hooke, Cassini, and others.</i>—Hooke and
Cassini were amongst the first to find definite spots on
the surface of Jupiter. From 1664 to 1667 a particularly
large and distinct spot was frequently seen in the planet’s
S. hemisphere. This object disappeared in the latter year,
but returned in 1672, and was seen until the close of
1674, when it again temporarily vanished, to reappear at
subsequent epochs. Cassini was enabled to determine the
rotation-period from this spot. He found that the markings
in the immediate vicinity of the equator moved with greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
celerity than those in higher latitudes, the difference in their
rotation-periods being nearly 6 minutes. A century later
Sir W. Herschel confirmed these results: he saw a bright
spot which completed a rotation in nearly 5 minutes less
time than several dark spots. Schröter also made many
observations, and noted frequent changes in the spots and
differences in their rotation-periods. He watched a bright
object near the equator which had a period more than
5 minutes less than some dark spots. In later years Mädler
and others followed up the investigation of these markings,
and with nearly similar results. The various spots were
undoubtedly affected by proper motions, enabling them
to yield discordant rotation-periods. Bright forms near the
equator moved with great rapidity and effected a rotation in
about 9<sup>h</sup> 50<sup>m</sup>, while dark spots on either side of it occupied
between 9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> and 9<sup>h</sup> 56<sup>m</sup>. The markings were evidently
controlled by currents of different velocities in the
planet’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>Dawes, in 1849 and following years, noted luminous spots,
like satellites in transit, on a belt in the planet’s S. hemisphere.
In October 1857 he observed a group of eleven of
these objects; and in 1858 Lassell saw many similar appearances
in a bright belt near the equator.</p>

<p><i>The Ellipse of 1869-70.</i>—In 1869 and 1870 Gledhill, of
Halifax, and Prof. Mayer, of the Lehigh University, saw
a remarkable formation just south of the great belt lying on
the S. side of the equator. It was in the form of a perfect
ellipse, ruddy in colour, and very distinct in outline. Its
major axis was parallel with the belts. It was first observed
on Nov. 14, 1869, and had disappeared in July 1870, though
on Dec. 1, 1871, a similar elliptic ring was seen resting on
the S. equatoreal dark band.</p>

<p><i>The Red Spot.</i>—In July 1878 a large spot, of oval form
and intense red colour, appeared in about the same latitude
as the ellipse seen by Gledhill and Mayer in 1869-70. It
was first announced by Dennett of Southampton, though it
appears to have been seen a few weeks earlier by Prof.
Pritchett, of Missouri, U.S.A. The object alluded to soon
attracted general notice; and as it continued visible during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
the oppositions of 1879, 1880, and 1881 under the same
striking aspect, it created a considerable stir among telescopists,
and the “great red spot on Jupiter” became
familiarly known both in appearance and in title.</p>

<p>No planetary marking in modern times has enlisted half the
amount of attention that has been devoted to this object. It
has endured amid all the turmoils of the Jovian atmosphere
for twelve years, and has preserved an integrity of form and
size which prove it to have been singularly capable of withstanding
disruption. But its tint has varied greatly; so that
at times the oval outline of the spot could hardly be discerned
amongst the contiguous belts. In the winter of 1881 the
interior of the ellipse began to lose tone, and in 1882 it faded
rapidly, so that the central region of the spot assumed nearly
the same light tint as the outlying bright belts. Apparently
the spot had either been filled up with luminous cloudy
material or had been partially obscured by the interposition
of matter situated higher in the Jovian atmosphere. The
elliptical contour of the object was still intact, however,
though it had quite lost its bold and prominent character.
Only the skeleton of its former self remained, and its entire
disappearance seemed imminent. But further decadence was
fortunately averted by influences unknown to us, and the spot
has continued visible to this day, though shorn of the attributes
which roused so much enthusiasm amongst observers more
than ten years ago.</p>

<p>From measures at Chicago, in the years from 1879 to 1884,
Prof. Hough found the mean dimensions of the spot to be:—Length
11″·75, breadth 3″·71. These figures represent a
real length of 25,900 miles and a diameter of 8200 miles.
The latitude of the spot was 6″·97 S.</p>

<p>This object has served an important end in attracting wide-spread
observation, not only to itself, but to the general phenomena
occurring on the surface of Jupiter. Observers, in
studying the red spot, were also led to study the bright
equatoreal spots and other features so plentifully distributed
over the disk. It was most important this should be done; for
since the time of Herschel and Schröter not much progress
had been made in elucidating the proper motions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
spots and finding an accurate rotation-period for the planet.
Dawes, Lassell, and many others had, it is true, secured some
interesting observations and drawings, but not of the special
kind required, and thus no fresh light had been thrown upon
the vagaries in the behaviour of the spots, as described by
the old observers. But a mass of new facts were now to
be realized. Schmidt at Athens, Prof. Hough at Chicago,
A. Stanley Williams at Brighton, and many others, including
myself at Bristol, began systematic observations
of Jupiter, with a view to learn something more of the
periods, changes, and general characteristics of the spots
and other features. The results were of an interesting
nature, though too extensive for more than bare mention
here. In 1879 the red spot gave a rotation-period of
9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 34<sup>s</sup>·2, but this increased to 9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 35<sup>s</sup>·6 in 1880-1
and to 9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 38<sup>s</sup>·2 in 1881-2. During the ensuing three
years the period was almost stationary at 9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 39<sup>s</sup>·1, but
in 1885-6 it further augmented to 9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 41<sup>s</sup>·1, since which
year it has ranged between 9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 40<sup>s</sup> and 41<sup>s</sup>. From
ten years’ observations, the mean period of the red spot
is as nearly as possible 9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 39<sup>s</sup>.</p>

<p><i>Bright Equatoreal Spots.</i>—The bright spots near the
equator rotated in 9<sup>h</sup> 50<sup>m</sup> 6<sup>s</sup> in 1880; but in subsequent
years the time slightly increased, for in 1882 I found it
9<sup>h</sup> 50<sup>m</sup> 8<sup>s</sup>·8, and in 1883 9<sup>h</sup> 50<sup>m</sup> 11<sup>s</sup>·4. The bright spots
therefore perform a rotation in 5½ minutes less time than the
red spot. The former move so much more swiftly than the
latter that they pass it at the rate of 260 miles per hour, and
in 44½ days have effected a complete circuit of Jupiter
relatively to it. Thus a brilliant white spot, if noticed in
the same longitude as the red spot on one night, will, on
subsequent nights, be observed to the W. of it, and, after an
interval of about 44½ days, the same objects will again
occupy coincident longitude.</p>

<p><i>Dark Spots in N. hemisphere.</i>—In the autumn of 1880
there was a confluent outbreak of dark spots from a belt in
about 25° N. latitude, and these exhibited a rotation-period
of only 9<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup>, so that they travelled more rapidly than the
white spots on the equator. Some short dusky belts were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
also remarked slightly S. of the latitude of the red spot, and
these indicated a period of 9<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 18<sup>s</sup>. It is clear from
these various results that the motion of the Jovian markings
does not decrease according to their distance from the
equator.</p>

<p><i>Rotation-Period.</i>—Below are given the times of rotation
ascertained by some previous observers:—</p>

<p>D: From ten years’ observations of the red spot.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>The foregoing list is by no means complete, for, owing to
the large number of recent determinations, I have thought
it advisable to omit some of them.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned here that the above times of
rotation are derived from atmospheric features more or
less volatile in nature, and that therefore the actual sphere
of Jupiter rotates in a period which we have not precisely
discovered. No doubt the motion of the real surface is not
very different from that of the atmospheric markings above
it. There is reason to think that, whatever the character of
the planet’s crust may be, we have never yet obtained a
glimpse of it. A dense veil of impenetrable vapours appears
to surround the globe on all sides, and this is subject to
violent derangement from the evolution of heated material or
gaseous fluids from the surface below. These disturbances
seem to be very durable in some instances as to their observed
effects. The atmosphere would, in fact, appear to possess a
singular capacity for retaining the impressions of its changes.
The permanency of certain spots can hardly be due to continued
action from those parts of the disk immediately underlying
them; for their variable motions soon transport them
far from the places at which they were first seen, and prove
their existence to be quite independent of their longitude.</p>

<p><i>Nature of the Red Spot.</i>—There is much in connection with
the red spot that remains in mystery. Its dimensions, form,
and motion have severally been ascertained within small
limits of error, and the alterations in its tint and degree
of visibility have been recorded with every care. But we
can only conjecture as to the origin, character, and end
of this remarkable formation. What agency produced it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
and moulded the definite elliptical outline it has always
preserved—what forces control its oscillations of speed, and
keep it suspended so long in the aerial envelope of Jupiter—are
matters of pure theory. When, in July 1878, it first
came under notice it was a well-developed object, and though
Russell in 1876, Lord Rosse and others in 1873, and Gledhill
and Mayer in 1869-70 had delineated forms suspiciously like
the red spot and situated in the same latitude, yet the several
features may not have been absolutely identical, for nothing
was seen of the spot in 1877 or in some other years. But
there is a strong probability that the red ellipse of 1869-70
must have been the red spot in an incipient stage of its
formation. The object may have undergone temporary
obscuration, similarly to Cassini’s spot two centuries ago.</p>

</div>

<p>My own opinion of the spot is that it represents an opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
in the atmosphere of Jupiter, through which, in 1878-82, we
saw the dense red vapours of his lower strata, if not his actual
surface itself. Its lighter tint in recent years is probably
due to the filling-in of the cavity by the encroachment of
durable clouds in the vicinity. Parts of some of the more
prominent belts display an intense red hue like that formerly
shown by the red spot, and they may be due to the same
causes. Extensive fissures are probably formed in the
atmosphere, and quickly distended in longitude by the
natural effect of the planet’s tremendous velocity of rotation.
It is curious, however, that these rents, after a certain distention,
assume a durable outline until they lose their
colouring and are temporarily if not finally obliterated.</p>

<p>When the red spot was visible under its best conditions
I frequently examined it, hoping to detect some mark well in
its interior which might serve as a clue to the true rotation-period
of the sphere of Jupiter. For if the spot consisted of
a clear patch in the planet’s atmosphere, I thought it possible
some real object on the surface might be discerned through
it, in which case the difference in its motion and that of the
red spot would enable the rate of motion of the globe to be
found. If the spot moves more slowly than the planet, then
a surface-marking must appear to pass from the E. to the W.
side of the spot; but no such evidence could be obtained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
owing to the absence of suitable markings. The red tint of
the great spot seemed very general over the entire area of
the ellipse until its central regions paled in 1882. There
were two dark specks, one at the E. and another at the
W. extremity of the spot; but these were unchangeable as
regards position.</p>

<div class="caption">Jupiter, 1886, April 9<sup>d</sup> 10<sup>h</sup> 12<sup>m</sup>.      (10-inch reflector; power 252.)</div>
</div>

<p>The spot, though placed very near the border of the great
S. belt, has never been connected with it, though in Jan.-Feb.
1884, May 1885, and March-April 1886 the spot
became temporarily attached to a belt on its S. side. There
was some controversy as to this feature, Prof. Hough, from
observations with the 18½-inch refractor at Chicago, alleging
that at no time had the spot coalesced with or been joined to
any belt in its vicinity. But in 1886 many observers succeeded
in detecting the junction of the markings alluded to,
and Prof. Young gave a drawing of the appearance as seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
with power 790 on the 23-inch objective at Princeton (see
‘Sidereal Messenger,’ vol. v. p. 292). The spot and belt
were probably at different heights in the Jovian atmosphere,
so that there was no commingling of material, one object
being simply projected on the other, for the elliptical form of
the red spot remained visible all the time. The latter moves
more slowly than the connecting belts, and, when clear of
them, is often seen with a white aureola fringing its environs.</p>

<p><i>Bright Equatoreal Spots.</i>—These are affected by rapid
changes of form, brightness, and motion. Sometimes they
are exceedingly bright; at other periods they are quite
invisible. This intermittency is not occasioned (as I assured
myself by many observations) by the total extinction of
spots and appearance of new ones, but is due to the temporary
obscuration of the same objects. The variations are
irregular, and probably depend upon phenomena also irregular.
The motion of these objects often shows great
deviations from their average rate; they are sometimes
much in advance of or behind their computed positions. One
fine spot of this class was closely watched in 1880 and
following years. It was usually in the shape of a brilliant
oval, well defined, and occasionally quite as large as the
third satellite of Jupiter; but it was sometimes seen as
a diffused white patch, apparently emerging from the N. edge
of the belt. Whenever the spot was very bright, there was a
trail of light or luminous matter running eastwards from it,
as though there were an eruption of shining material from the
spot, which the rapid rotation of the planet from W. to E.
caused to drift in an opposite direction.</p>

<p><i>Dark Equatoreal Spots.</i>—Closely contiguous to the white
spots there are almost invariably seen very dark spots, much
deeper in tone than the dark belt upon which they appear to
be projected. It has been suggested that these dark spots are
shadows from the white spots, which may be elevated formations
protruding through the envelope of Jupiter. This idea
seems to me untenable; for the dark spots have been distinguished
under a vertical Sun, and sometimes they are found
one on each side of a white spot. Again, an intensely brilliant
spot is occasionally seen without any outlying condensation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
dark matter. But though they are not shadows, the dark
equatoreal spots certainly have an intimate relation with the
brighter markings near them and move with the same
velocity.</p>

<p>It is proved from many observations that the longer an
object is observed the slower becomes its rate of rotation.
Sir W. Herschel found the converse. In discussing his
results of 1778 and 1779, he said:—“By a comparison of the
different periods it appears that a spot gradually performs its
revolutions in less time than at first” (Phil. Trans. 1781,
p. 126). But his periods were each based on less than fifty
rotations, so that no certain conclusions could be derived from
them.</p>

<p>In recent years the rapidly moving bright spots have
usually appeared in the equatoreal side of the great S. dark
belt. The polar side of the great N. belt also exhibits bright
spots, but these rotate in a period only a few seconds less than
that of the red spot. Bright spots are also observed to the
S. of the latter object and on other portions of the disk.</p>

<p>As to the belts, they are usually straight; but cases are
recorded of slant-belts, in which the direction has been very
oblique. One of these was noticed in the planet’s N. hemisphere
in Mar.-April 1860, and another was seen in the
S. hemisphere in Jan. 1872. I observed one near the
N. polar shading in Dec. 1881.</p>

<p><i>New Belts.</i>—The formation of the dark belts seems to
be brought about gradually, and they appear to be sustained
in certain cases by eruptions of dark matter, which gradually
spread out into streams. On Oct. 17, 1880, two dark spots,
separated by 20° of longitude, broke out on a belt some
25° N. of the equator. Other spots quickly formed on each
side of the pair alluded to, and distended themselves along
the belt so that by Dec. 30 they covered three fourths of its
entire circumference. At the middle of January the spots
formed a complete girdle round the planet; but they became
much fainter, and were soon eradicated by combination with
the belt on which they had appeared.</p>

<p><i>Changes on Jupiter.</i>—Prof. Hough, of Chicago, is adverse
to the opinion that rapid changes occur on Jupiter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
mentions the stability of the red spot and other markings in
support of his views. He believes that the erroneous statements
about sudden changes made by both ancient and
modern astronomers are largely due to differences in the
telescopic images due to atmospheric variations. No doubt
such an explanation will suffice to meet some instances, and
the swift rotation of the planet may also have been the unsuspected
cause of some of the extraordinary changes described;
but there are real variations as well. These are very frequent
in the planet’s equatoreal zone.</p>

<p><i>Further Observations required.</i>—Drawings of Jupiter obtained
under the highest powers that may be employed with
advantage, and with a cautious regard to faithful delineation,
will probably throw much light on the phenomena occurring
in this planet’s atmosphere. And it is most desirable to
pursue the various markings year after year with unflagging
perseverance; for it is only by such means that we can hope
to unravel the extraordinary problem which their visible behaviour
offers for solution. Too much stress cannot possibly
be laid on the necessity of observers being as precise as
possible in their records. The times when an object comes to
the central meridian should be invariably noted; for this
affords a clue to its longitude, and a means of determining its
velocity. Its position, N. or S. of the equator, should be
either measured or estimated; and alterations in tone, figure,
or tint described, with a view to ascertain its real character.</p>

<p>The climate of England is very ill-adapted to an investigation
of this sort, where the most needful point consists in
frequency of observation. If the markings on Jupiter could
be re-examined every night, and traced through their changes,
an explanation of certain phenomena exhibited by them would
soon be forthcoming. The interrupted character of previous
observations destroys much of their value. Closely consecutive
results are necessary to remove doubts as to the identity of the
objects observed; so that, in such a research, natural advantages
of position are more desirable than instrumental advantages,
for the latter are impotent in a cloudy atmosphere.</p>

<p>The red spot must be watched as long as any vestiges of
it remain. Its variations of speed may ultimately yield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
indications of periodicity<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>; so may its alterations of tint.
The belts in the vicinity of the spot demand an equal share
of attention; for it may be possible to divine from their
changes whether there are any links of association between
them and the red spot. In recent years the latter has apparently
repulsed the belts on its N. side, though suffering
encroachments from those on its S. side.</p>

<p>The equatoreal spots also deserve continued vigilance on
the part of observers. It has already been stated that the
bright spots vary rapidly; their motions are not uniform
in rate, and what is now wanted is a large number of new
observations. Does accelerated velocity occur with increased
brilliancy of these objects? Are their alternating disappearances
and revivals uniform in period? and are they
really due to transitory obscurations of the same durable
forms? Are the dark spots which frequently border the
white spots implicated in effacing the latter? Many other
questions like these are suggested by the curious behaviour
of the markings, and the discriminating observer will know
how to gather the materials likely to aid in answering them.
The rotation-period has been already found in regard to
many features; but this element may be re-investigated with
profit, for the velocity of the spots offers a very complex
problem for solution. Do the markings generally exhibit a
retardation of speed as long as they subsist? Abnormal
spots, such as those which made their apparition in the
autumn of 1880, should be traced through any vagaries
they may present; and peculiar shape or direction in the
belts will also merit study, as possibly supplying facts of
consequence. It will be important to learn whether objects
in a certain latitude have a common rotation-period, or
whether different forms give different times. The rate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
motion shown by certain features may depend upon their
character, and not so much upon their position in latitude.</p>

<p>The altitudes of the various markings affords another
promising line of research. The appearances and changes
of closely contiguous features may be expected to furnish
useful data in this connection. Owing to their proper
motions they apparently overlap each other at times, and
in their alterations of aspect the observer may discover
the clue to their relative heights. The subject is discussed
in a practical and interesting way by Mr. Green (Memoirs
R. A. S. vol. xlix. p. 264) and by Mr. Stanley Williams
(‘Zenographic Fragments,’ i. p. 112), and these works should
be consulted by everyone engaged in the study of Jovian
phenomena.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the observer, in delineating this
object, must perforce adopt an extremely hurried method of
representing what he sees at the telescope. The planet turns
so quickly upon his axis that forms near the central meridian
become sensibly displaced in a few minutes; indeed, it has
been stated that an interval of two minutes only is sufficient
to introduce a change obvious to simple eye-estimation. In
order, therefore, to complete a sketch, the utmost dispatch is
requisite; for this object cannot be depicted from the combined
outcome of several evenings of observation. The
proper motions of the different features prevent this. With
Mars, or any orb exhibiting markings relatively constant,
collective results are extremely valuable, and more trustworthy
than pictures depending upon an isolated observation.</p>

<p>Amateurs, in entering upon these observations, should be
prepared for rapid changes in the apparent aspect of Jupiter
caused by his rotation, and not hastily infer them to be real.
They should also hesitate before placing confidence in any
anomalous results obtained under indifferent seeing; for bad
images have been directly responsible for many misleading
announcements.</p>

<div class="caption">Occultation of Jupiter, Aug. 7, 1889.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Occultations of Jupiter by the Moon.</i>—Phenomena of this
kind are always awaited with keen interest by the possessors
of telescopes; but it is rarely that all the circumstances are
favourable. The first recorded instance appears to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 847. In 1792, on April 7, Schröter observed an
occultation of this planet, with a desire to verify his suspicion
of a lunar atmosphere. He saw that “some of the
satellites became indistinct at the limb of the Moon, while
others did not suffer any change of colour. The belts and
spots of Jupiter appeared perfectly distinct when close to the
limb of the Moon.” On Jan. 2, 1857, an occultation took place
under conditions which rendered it visible to many observers
in this country, and the most interesting fact elicited was that
at emersion a dark border was seen attached to the arc of the
Moon projected on the planet. Mr. Lassell described this
dark border as “a shadowy line, in character, magnitude, and
intensity extremely like Saturn’s obscure ring projected on
the ball.” During the thirty years following 1859 only two
occultations visible in England occurred, and the last of
these, on August 7, 1889, was widely observed. On this
occasion Capt. Noble and others redetected the shadowed
edge of the Moon seen by Lassell in 1857. “It was a
strongly marked shading, following the outline of the Moon’s
limb.” At Bristol I recorded that, at the disappearance, the
outer margin of our satellite was fringed with light where it
crossed the planet; but at the reappearance this effect had
vanished, and the appearance was perfectly normal. The
disk of Jupiter, where it met the edge of the lunar disk,
looked dusky by the effects of contrast; but I saw no
marked shading with a sharply terminating boundary, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
as appears to have been remarked elsewhere. As the planet
emerged definition was superb, the belts were lividly distinct,
and the spectacle was one of the prettiest that could be
imagined. The red spot was going off the W. limb, and the
disk was covered with belts; many of them near the poles
were extremely narrow, like fine lines drawn with a sharp
lead pencil. I used a 4-inch refractor, powers 65 and 145,
with this instrument the foregoing sketch was made. The
exceptional distinctness of the Jovian markings on this
occasion shows that the proximity of the Moon has certainly
no tendency to efface planetary details, but rather to intensify
them<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>.</p>

<p>On Sept. 3, 1889, an occultation of Jupiter was visible in
America, and observed by Mr. Brooks at Geneva, N.Y., with
a 10-1/8-inch equatoreal. His drawing, made from a photograph
and eye-observations, shows nothing of a dark fringe
bordering the Moon’s limb.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The four Satellites.</i>—When Galilei directed his telescope
to Jupiter on the evening of Jan. 7, 1610, he saw three
small star-like points near the planet; so:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/202a.jpg"  alt="Illustrating the above paragraph." />
</div>

<p>On Jan. 13 he discovered a fourth; thus:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/202b.jpg"  alt="Illustrating the above paragraph." />
</div>

<p>and ascertaining that these bodies followed Jupiter in his
course, concluded them to be moons in attendance upon him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
At first the discovery was discredited by others; but it soon
had to be accepted as an incontestable fact of observation.
These satellites are usually among the very first objects which
the amateur views in his telescope, and they form, in combination
with their primary, an exquisite picture, the impression
of which is not soon forgotten. The periods, distances, &amp;c. of

<p>The third satellite is much the largest, and its brightness is
about equal to that of a star of the 6th mag. The other three
may be rated as generally 7th mag., though their brightness
is variable, especially that of the fourth satellite, which has
been seen exceedingly faint.</p>

<p>It is customary to distinguish these objects, not by their
names, as in the case of the moons of Mars, Saturn, and
Uranus, but by the Roman numbers affixed to them progressively
according to their distances from Jupiter.</p>

<p>The satellites are just visible to the naked eye when the
conditions favour their detection; but they are so much
involved in the rays of the planet, and often so near to him,
that it may be regarded as an exceptional feat to discern them
without telescopic aid. When III. and IV. are near their
max. elongation and on the same side of the planet, they have
been occasionally observed separately. I. and II., though
much closer to Jupiter and more within the influence of his
glare and rays, have been similarly seen. When attempting
such observations it is best to hide the bare disk of the planet
behind some terrestrial object, as this will cut off the obnoxious
rays and prevent the brilliant light from dazzling the eye. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
opera-glass, or any small portable telescope, reveals the whole
retinue of satellites, and enables them to be traced through
their revolutions. The ‘Nautical Almanack’ gives diagrams
of their diurnal positions, and with this work as a reference
observers will find no difficulty in identifying them apart.</p>

<p>Sir W. Herschel, in the years 1794 to 1796, found that
the satellites revolve on their axes in the same time that they
revolve about the planet. He was led to this conclusion by a
study of the variations in the light emitted by the satellites in
different parts of their orbits, and described I. as “of a very
intense bright, white, and shining light,—brighter than II. or
IV. (not larger). IV. inclines to red, and nearly as bright
as II. The latter is of a dull ash-colour. III. is very white.”
Modern observers have selected II. as relatively the most
highly reflective, while IV. is the least. Spots exist on the
surfaces of these objects, and probably occasion many of the
differences observed.</p>

<p>The eclipses, occultations, and transits of the satellites
afford a very fertile and attractive series of phenomena for
telescopic review. The exact times of occurrence are tabulated
in the ‘Nautical Almanack’ and asterisks are affixed to such as
are visible in this country. Prior to the date of opposition of
Jupiter the eclipses occur of course on the W. side of the disk,
while after opposition they take place on the E. side. The
durations are as follow for the several satellites:—I. = 2<sup>h</sup> 20<sup>m</sup>,
II. = 2<sup>h</sup> 56<sup>m</sup>, III. = 3<sup>h</sup> 43<sup>m</sup>, IV. = 4<sup>h</sup> 56<sup>m</sup>. In reference to
III. and IV. the entire phenomenon may be generally
observed; but this is not so in regard to II., as the emersions
are frequently effected behind the planet. Only the immersions
of I. are visible before opposition, from the same cause;
for the satellite enters the cone of shadow close to the planet’s
limb, and only comes out of it when the globe of the planet
is interposed in the line of sight. In such cases the satellite
emerges soon after from the limb of Jupiter; so that its
obscuration has been compounded of two separate phenomena,
viz. an eclipse and an occultation. After opposition this
satellite is first occulted and then eclipsed. IV. sometimes
escapes eclipse altogether, by passing above or below the
shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>The motion of light was discovered, and its velocity determined,
by means of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites. These
phenomena are also useful in ascertaining longitudes. A
spectator on Jupiter himself would see a vast number of solar
and lunar eclipses—about 4500 of each—during the Jovian
year of 4332·6 days, because the three inner satellites exhibit
these phenomena at every revolution, their orbits being very
slightly inclined to Jupiter’s equator, and the latter being but
little inclined to the plane of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>The occultations of the satellites are comparatively frequent,
and may be well observed in a good telescope. A tolerably
high magnifier is required to witness these occurrences with
the best effect, the disks of the satellites being small and not
clearly traceable through the various stages of their disappearances
unless much amplified. With considerable telescopic
power the disks are well seen, and it then becomes
feasible to watch the satellites, first as they come into contact
with the limb, then as the globe of the planet overlaps more
and more of their diminutive forms, and finally as they reach
last contact and withdraw their narrow unobscured segments
behind the expansive sphere of their primary. Both the
beginning and end phase of these occultations is generally
observable in regard to Sat. IV., and frequently also in the
case of III. But with reference to II. and I. it often happens
that only the disappearance or reappearance can be witnessed.
These occultations have furnished some singular and unexplained
facts of observation. On meeting the limb of Jupiter
Sats. I. and II. have not always disappeared in a normal way.
On April 26, 1863, Wray, with an 8-inch objective, saw II.
distinctly projected within the limb for nearly 20<sup>s</sup>. Other
similar cases are recorded. The satellites have been seen
apparently “through the edge of the disk.” One observer
mentions that II. appeared and disappeared several times
before occultation. The explanation appears to be that there
is so much irradiation round the disk of Jupiter that it produces
a false limb, and it is through this the satellites have
been seen. A very tremulous image, in bad air, may also be
responsible for some of the anomalies recorded.</p>

<p>The transits of the Jovian moons offer the most attractive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
phenomena of all, and they come well within the reach of
small telescopes. On entering upon the planet they are
visible as bright round spots projected on the dusky limb, and
subsequently present some eccentric features. II. is invisible,
except on the limbs; I. is often seen as a grey spot threading
along the belts; III. appears as a large dark spot<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>, nearly as
black as its shadow; IV. seems to be black, and scarcely to
be recognized from its shadow. The appearances are certainly
to some extent variable. Mr. Stanley Williams has
seen III. as a <em>brilliant</em> disk at mid-transit. I. sometimes
crosses the whole disk as a white spot; at certain other times
it is invisible; at others, again, it is seen as a faint grey
spot. IV. is not always black, its aspect depending upon the
chord it traverses. Thus, on the evening of Sept. 12, 1889,
Mr. Williams, Mr. G. T. Davis of Reading, and myself
were observing Jupiter when IV. was in transit on a belt
in the N. hemisphere, but not a vestige of the satellite was
seen by any of us. On the morning of May 23, 1890, at
3<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, however, while observing the red spot on
Jupiter, I noticed a black circular spot on the great N.
equatoreal belt; and this proved to be IV. in transit. These
peculiarities have been accounted for as partly due to contrast
and partly to dusky spots on the surfaces of the satellites.
Dr. Spitta has made a number of experiments to elucidate
this subject, and concludes that “the perpetual whiteness of
the second satellite, and the darkened tints of the others
during transit, are due to differences in their relative albedo
[reflective power] as compared with that of Jupiter, and are
not dependent upon the relative quantity of light reflected by
one or the other, or upon any physical peculiarities of the
Jovian system.”</p>

<p>The shadows of the satellites transit the disk as dark spots
larger than the satellites themselves, owing to the penumbral
fringes. Before opposition these shadows precede the satellites;
after opposition the latter come first. The shadow of II.
appears to be much lighter than the others, and is usually of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
a pale chocolate-colour; and I saw it thus at the opening of
the year 1885:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_37"></a>Fig. 37.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(35).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Shadows of Jupiter’s Satellites II. and III. near an equatoreal
white spot (Jan. 1, 1885, 7<sup>h</sup> 20<sup>m</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>).</div>
</div>

<p>Sat. II. is probably involved in an atmosphere sufficiently
dense to enable it to present undue luminosity relatively to
the others; and if so, the feeble shadow it transmits on
Jupiter may be partly explained by the effects of refraction.
On the day of opposition both satellites and shadows are
projected on the same part of the disk, and the latter are
occulted by the former. On Jan. 14, 1872, Mr. F. M. Newton
saw I. centrally placed on its shadow; so that the satellite was
apparently surrounded with a ring of shade. On May 13,
1876, Mr. G. D. Hirst saw Sat. I. partly occulting its own
shadow; a black crescent was seen in the bright zone N. of
the equator. On Feb. 18, 1885, Dr. R. Copeland, at Dun
Echt, saw the shadow of I. “almost totally occulted by the
satellite itself; as the satellite approached Jupiter’s limb it
came out quite bright and large, with a mere crescent of the
shadow showing on its southern edge.” This phenomenon
was also observed at Bristol.</p>

<p>Occasionally all the satellites become invisible at the same
time, being either eclipsed, occulted, or in transit. An instance
of this kind was recorded by Molyneux on Nov. 2, 1681 (O.S.).
Sir W. Herschel observed a similar occurrence on May 23,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
1802; also Wallis on April 15, 1826, and Dawes and others
on Sept. 27, 1843, and Aug. 21, 1867. A visible repetition
of the event was narrowly avoided on the morning of Oct. 15,
1883. On this occasion the planet should, according to the
‘Nautical Almanack,’ have been denuded of his satellites for a
period of 19 minutes; but this disappearance did not occur,
for at no time were all the satellites included within the
margin or shadow of Jupiter. I observed that Sat. III.
entered upon the disk just as IV. released itself, and the two
formed a curious configuration at 4<sup>h</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, hanging close
upon the planet’s limbs.</p>

<p>Spots have been seen on the satellites both in transit and
while shining on the dark sky. This particularly refers to
III. and IV. II. has never given indications of such
markings on its bright uniformly clear surface. Dawes,
Lassell, and Secchi frequently observed and drew the spots.
Secchi described III. as similar in aspect to the mottled
disk of Mars as seen in a small telescope; his drawings
exhibit no analogy, however, to those by Dawes of the same
object. III. has been remarked of a curious shape, as if
dark spots obliterated part of the limbs. Sat. I. was observed
in transit on Sept. 8, 1890 by Barnard and Burnham, and it
appeared to be <em>double</em>, being divided by a bright interval or
belt. They used a 12-inch refractor, powers 500 and 700,
and the seeing was very fine.</p>

<p>Many other curious points have been noticed in the various
aspects and phenomena of the Jovian satellites. Further
observations will doubtless throw new light on some of the
puzzling records of the past.</p>

<p><i>Occultation of a Star.</i>—An occultation of the 7th mag. star
4 Geminorum by Jupiter took place on Nov. 7, 1882, and it
was observed by Prof. Pritchett, of Glasgow, Missouri, with a
12-1/4-inch equatoreal, power 200. “The images of both planet
and star were very steady. The margin of Jupiter’s disk
was very sharply defined. The immersion was very near the
N. border of the broad S. equatoreal belt. At 11<sup>h</sup> 28<sup>m</sup> 10<sup>s</sup>·65
local mean time the star was <em>apparently</em> within the dark
outline of the disk, apparent geometric contact having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>occurred at 11<sup>h</sup> 20<sup>m</sup> 24<sup>s</sup>·49. For a moment the star seemed
to disappear, but a moment later was plainly seen, as if
through a well-defined notch in the otherwise <em>continuously
even</em> margin. This notch lasted 46<sup>s</sup>·26, and at 11<sup>h</sup> 28<sup>m</sup> 56<sup>s</sup>·91
it <em>vanished</em>, and the light of the star was <em>entirely extinguished</em>.”
The emersion of the star could not be observed, as clouds
supervened.</p>

<p>This planet shines brighter than an ordinary first-magnitude
star, and is a pretty conspicuous object, though less luminous
than either Venus, Jupiter, or Mars. He emits a dull
yellowish light, steadier than the sparkling lustre of Mercury
or Venus.</p>

<p>The globe of Saturn is surrounded by a system of highly
reflective rings, giving to the planet a character of form
which finds no parallel among the other orbs of our system.
His peculiar construction is well calculated to be attractive in
the highest degree to all those who take delight in viewing
the wonders of the heavens. Saturn is justly considered one
of the most charming pictures which the telescope unfolds.
A person who for the first time beholds the planet, encircled
in his rings and surrounded by his moons, can hardly subdue
an exclamation of surprise and wonder at a spectacle as
unique as it is magnificent. Even old observers, who again
and again return to the contemplation of this remarkable
orb, confess they do so unwearyingly, because they find no
parallel elsewhere; the beautifully curving outline of the
symmetrical image always retains its interest, and refreshes
them with thoughts of the Divine Architect who framed it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>The luminous system of rings attending this planet not only
gratifies the eye but gives rise to entertaining speculations as
to its origin, character, and purposes with regard to the globe
of Saturn. Why, it has been asked, was this planet alone
endowed with so novel an appendage? and what particular
design does it fulfil in the economy of Saturn? It cannot be
regarded as simply an ornament in the firmament, but must
subserve important ends, though these may not yet have been
revealed to the eye of our understanding.</p>

<p><i>Period &amp;c.</i>—Saturn revolves round the Sun in 10,759 days
5 hrs. 16 min., which is equal to nearly 29½ years. His
mean distance from the Sun is 886,000,000 miles, but this
interval varies from 841 to 931 millions, owing to the
eccentricity of his orbit. When in opposition his apparent
diameter reaches 20″·7, and declines to 15″ at the time of
conjunction. The planet’s actual diameter is 75,000 miles,
and his polar compression very considerable, viz. about 1/10,
which exceeds that of any other planet. His synodic period
is equal to 378 days; so that he comes into opposition with
the Sun thirteen days later every year. The oblate figure of
his disk is very noticeable when the rings are turned edgeways
to the Earth and practically invisible; but when they are
inclined the complete contour of the globe is lost, and the
polar flattening becomes scarcely obvious.</p>

<p><i>“Square-shouldered” Aspect.</i>—Sir W. Herschel, from observations
in April 1805, said:—“There is a singularity
which distinguishes the figure of Saturn from that of all the
other planets.” On April 19 of the year named he described
the planet as “like a parallelogram with the four corners
rounded off deeply, but not so much as to bring it to a
spheroid.” This gave the globe a “square-shouldered”
aspect. But this curious figure appears to have been very
rarely observed in subsequent years; and accurate measures
with the micrometer were adduced in 1833-48 in proof that
no such anomaly had a real existence. Dr. Kitchiner, commenting
on Herschel’s remarks, said:—“I have occasionally
observed this planet during thirty years, and I do not
remember to have seen the body of it of this singular form
except for a few months about September 1818.” But there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
is no doubt that occasionally the planet <em>does</em> assume an
<em>apparent</em> form similar to that attributed to it by Herschel.
In the autumn of 1880 I studied the visible appearance of
Saturn by means of a 10-inch reflector, and recorded as
follows:—“The S. pole, over which the dark belts lay, seemed
compressed in the most remarkable manner; but where a
bright belt intervened, in about lat. 45°, the contrary effect
was produced. Here the limbs were apparently raised (by
irradiation) above the spherical contour; so that the distorted
image gave the planet that distinctly ‘square-shouldered’
aspect sometimes mentioned in text-books.” The explanation
appears to me very simple. The singular figure is due to the
contrasting effects of the belts. While the bright belt in
lat. 45° causes a very evident shouldering-out of the limbs at
its extremities, the dark belts nearer the pole and the equator
act with opposite effect, for they apparently compress the disk
where they meet the limbs, and thus the eye discerns a figure
to all appearance distorted into the “square-shouldered”
form. Mr. J. L. McCance confirmed these remarks by
independent observations at the same period with a 10-inch
reflector by Calver (‘Monthly Notices,’ vol. xli. pp. 84, 282).</p>

<p><i>Early Observations.</i>—The appearance of Saturn offered a
considerable difficulty to observers soon after the invention of
the telescope. Galilei became greatly perplexed. He saw
the planet, not as a circular globe like Jupiter, but distinctly
elongated in shape, and conceived the appearance to be due to
a central globe with smaller spheres hanging on the sides! He
continued his observations, without, however, arriving at the
solution of the mystery, until the malformation began to disappear;
and in 1612 he was astonished to find the disk
spherical. In his surprise, he asked—“Were the appearances
indeed illusion and fraud, with which the glasses have so long
deceived me, as well as many others to whom I have shown
them?... The shortness of the time, the unexpected nature
of the event, the weakness of my understanding, and the fear
of being mistaken, have greatly confounded me.” Gassendi,
in 1633, also announced that Saturn appeared to him to be
closely attended by two globes of the same colour as the planet.
Riccioli alleged that the planet was surrounded by a thin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
plain, elliptic ring, connected with the sphere by two arms.
None of Galilei’s contemporaries possessed the instrumental
means to extricate him from his doubts; and it remained for
Huygens, in 1654 (twelve years after the death of Galilei), to
discover that Saturn “is surrounded by a slender flat ring,
which in no part coheres with the body of the planet, and is
inclined to the ecliptic”<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>. The same observer showed that
the disappearance which had so puzzled Galilei arose from the
varying inclination in the ring: at times it would become
invisible, when presenting its narrow edge to the Earth, and
this actually occurred again in 1671, as Huygens had predicted.
In 1676 Cassini detected a belt upon the planet, and
also a dark division in the ring. Dr. Smith’s ‘Optics’ (1738)
thus alludes to these discoveries:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_38"></a>Fig. 38.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(36).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Saturn, as observed by Cassini in August 1676.</div>
</div>

<p>“In the year 1676, after Saturn had emerged from the
Sun’s rays, Sig. Cassini saw him in the morning twilight
with a darkish belt upon his globe, parallel to the long axis
of his ring as usual. But what was most remarkable, the
broad side of the ring was bisected right round by a dark
elliptical line, dividing it, as it were, into two rings, of which
the inner ring appeared brighter than the outer one, with
nearly the like difference in brightness as between that of
silver polished and unpolished—which, though never observed
before, was seen many times after with tubes of
34 and 20 feet, and more evidently in the twilight or moonlight
than in a darker sky.”</p>

<p>From the time when Galilei’s inadequate glass revealed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
“threefold” aspect of Saturn, and led up to Huygens’s
solution of the mystery in 1654, this planet has been successively
interrogated with the improved telescopes which every
generation has produced. Cassini, W. Herschel, Encke,
Bond, Lassell, Dawes, and Hall are names familiar to us
as having materially advanced our knowledge of this unique
orb, both as to his surface-configuration and as to his numerous
retinue of satellites.</p>

<p><i>Belts and Spots on the Planet.</i>—Parallel belts are seen on
the surface of Saturn, but they are much fainter than those
on Jupiter, and they seldom display the spots and other irregularities
interspersed with the belts of the latter planet. Well-bounded
spots have rarely been distinguished on the disk of
Saturn; the belts normally appear equal in tone, without
breaks, condensations, abrupt curves, or branches, so that the
rotation-period has only been accurately determined by
Herschel and Hall. And in these cases the markings were
certainly atmospheric, and probably affected by proper
motions similar to those operating on Jupiter.</p>

<p>Cassini and Fatio remarked two bright streaks on the
planet as early as 1683. Sir W. Hershel, in 1790, observed
a very dark spot near the margin of the limb, and a few
modern observers have been successful in distinguishing either
bright or dark spots or patches, though no continuous and
useful observations appear to have been secured. In the
winter of 1793 Herschel noticed a very distinct quintuple belt,
which consisted of three dusky and two intervening light
zones. The dark belts presented a dusky yellow hue, while
the spaces separating them were white. He recognized the
evidences of rotation in the quintuple belt; for on the same
nights, after a few hours’ interval, it exhibited considerable
variation. Though seen with great precision at first, it
became indistinct at a later hour, and the individual belts
were placed at unequal distances.</p>

<p><i>Rotation-Period.</i>—Prof. A. Hall, at Washington, discovered
on Dec. 7, 1876, a well-defined white spot, 2″ or 3″ in
diameter, and situated just below the ring of Saturn. He
watched this object till Jan. 2 following, when it had become
faint and indistinct, and the planet being low and the weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
unfavourable no further observations were made. The spot
had fortunately been seen at four other observatories in the
United States, Prof. Hall having notified its existence to
them; and on discussing the results, a rotation-period was
found not differing largely from Herschel’s value derived from
the quintuple belt in 1793. These are, in fact, the only two
determinations on which we may place confidence. They are
as below:—</p>

<p>Schröter, from different spots, computed periods of
11<sup>h</sup> 40<sup>m</sup> 30<sup>s</sup>, 11<sup>h</sup> 51<sup>m</sup>, and more than 12<sup>h</sup>; but these are
probably excessive. The difference of 1<sup>m</sup> 37<sup>s</sup> between the
values of Herschel and Hall is relatively a trivial one, as the
markings observed were doubtless atmospheric and subject to
irregularities of motion. As to the rotation of the ring,
Herschel, in 1789, detected some bright marks on it, and
deduced the period as 10<sup>h</sup> 32<sup>m</sup> 15<sup>s</sup>·4<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>. Many astronomical
works give the rotation-period of Saturn as 10<sup>h</sup> 29<sup>m</sup> 16<sup>s</sup>·8;
and this is adopted in Chambers’s ‘Descriptive Astronomy,’
4th edit. vol. i. p. 653. The mistake has its origin in
Laplace’s <i lang="fr">Système du Monde</i>, where it is stated that Saturn
rotates in 0·428 of a day, and the ring in 0·437, which,
reduced to hours, minutes, and seconds, give 10<sup>h</sup> 16<sup>m</sup> 17<sup>s</sup>·2
and 10<sup>h</sup> 29<sup>m</sup> 16<sup>s</sup>·8.</p>

<p>The equator of Saturn is usually the brightest part of the
disk. On its S. side, in recent years, it has been bounded by
a very dark narrow belt. Further S. the whole disk seems
involved in a faint shading, of a decidedly yellowish hue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Sometimes a considerable number of belts are visible; but
they are evidently liable to changes, so that the same number
and arrangement are not preserved from year to year.</p>

<p><i>The Rings.</i>—As to the luminous rings, the extreme diameter
of the outer one is about 40″, or more than 170,000 miles;
and the black division, separating it from the inner one, is
0″·4, or 1700 miles. The outer ring has a breadth of 2″·4, or
10,000 miles; while the inner one measures 3″·9, or 17,000
miles. The outer ring is less luminous than the inner; the
latter, round its outer edges, is extremely brilliant, and has
sometimes been described as the brightest part of the
Saturnian system. The inner part of this ring is much
shaded-off, and offers a strong contrast to the silvery whiteness
of the other portion.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Divisions in the Outer Ring.</i>—In the middle of the eighteenth
century Short, the optician, using one of his excellent reflectors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
thought he saw the outer ring divided by several dark lines;
but no other observer confirmed his suspicion. In the third
decade of the present century Quetelet and Capt. Kater appear
to have observed Short’s divisions, but Sir J. Herschel and
Struve looked for them in vain. In 1837 Encke fully satisfied
himself, by several observations and measurements, as to
the objective existence of the divided outer ring. The division
was not central, cutting the ring into equal parts, but situated
in the inner part of the ring, so that the wider part was outermost.
In subsequent years this division has been sometimes
seen and placed nearest the outer edge of the ring. Certain
observers, provided with ample means, have seen nothing of
it; others regard the division as variable. It is sometimes
described as a narrow black line; while others refer to it as
a faint pencil~like shading, and not a real division at all. One
observer occasionally sees it with considerable distinctness at
the very same time that another observer, with a more powerful
telescope, cannot glimpse it though looking specially for such
an appearance! It is difficult to reconcile such discordant
experiences, and unsafe to accept results of such a contradictory
nature.</p>

<p><i>The “Crape”-Ring.</i>—A far more certain feature was discovered
in the autumn of 1850<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>, and one in reference to which
there is unanimity of testimony. On Nov. 11 G. P. Bond, in
America, and Dawes, in England, on Nov. 25, saw a nebulosity
or faint luminous appearance like twilight, fringing the interior
margin of the inner ring. Later observations showed this to
be occasioned by a transparent ring situated immediately
within the inner luminous ring. Dawes considered the new
ring to be divided into two parts; but Lassell, with his large
reflector, subsequently negatived this supposition. Both limbs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
of Saturn may be readily perceived through the transparent
ring where it crosses the globe of the planet. Some irregularities
have been suspected in it at different times by various
observers. In 1887 dark condensations were reported to
disturb its normal aspect; but these were not seen at many
observatories where such features, if real, could hardly have
escaped detection.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_40"></a>Fig. 40.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(38).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Saturn, as observed by F. Terby, February 1887.</div>
</div>

<p>It is strange to reflect that this transparent ring avoided
discovery for so long a period. It forms a feature distinctly
to be recognized in relatively small telescopes—in fact, Grover
has seen it, where it crosses the globe of Saturn, with only
2 inches of aperture. Yet, though ever on the alert to detect
new formations, and exercising constant vigilance in their
pursuit, Sir W. Herschel, Schröter, and many others allowed
this ring to escape them! There is no reason to suppose that
it is variable, and that it was not so plain a century ago as now.
It affords another instance of how easily an unknown object
may elude recognition, though everyone sees it readily enough
when attention is called to it.</p>

<p>In March 1889 a white spot was detected on the rings by
Dr. Terby, at Louvain, and it was seen by other observers with
comparatively small instruments. The spot was stationary,
and placed near the apparent junction of the globe and rings,
in the E. ansa. But with large telescopes nothing of this
object could be detected: it was shown to be an optical effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p><i>Discordant Observations.</i>—It is curious that the details of
Saturn have occasioned more dissension amongst observers
than those of any other planet. This may have partly arisen
from the great distance of Saturn, the comparative feebleness
of his light, and complexity of his structure. The planet is
usually better defined than either Mars or Jupiter; but with
tolerably high powers on small instruments the image is
faint, and the features so diluted that the impressions received
cannot always be depended upon, especially when the air is
unsteady. A fluttering condition of the object is sufficient in
itself to cause deception. Prof. Hall, in speaking of the work
done by the 25·8-inch refractor at Washington in 1883,
says:—“Saturn’s ring has been observed, but many of the
strange phenomena noted by other observers have not been
seen even on the best nights.” The evidence afforded by
this large instrument may not always be conclusive, but in
this case there can be no doubt it properly failed to show
“phenomena” which had no existence.</p>

<p><i>Eccentric Position of the Rings.</i>—The rings are slightly
eccentric with regard to the ball; in other words, the ball is
not situated in the centre of the rings. Differences have been
observed denoting this, though the observations are not altogether
satisfactory. It has been shown theoretically that the
eccentricity referred to is necessary to maintain the stable
equilibrium of the system; for were the rings perfectly concentric
with the planet, they must coalesce with the ball.
The preservation of so complicated a structure must evidently
require judicious and nicely balanced conditions.</p>

<p>With the great 23-inch refractor at Princeton, U.S.A., the
ball of Saturn was seen through the division in the ring in
November 1883—an observation which had previously been
made by Lassell in 1852.</p>

<p><i>Aspect of the Rings.</i>—In different years the rings present a
varying outline, owing to the fact of their inclination (28° 10´)
and to changes in the relative positions of the Earth and
Saturn. At intervals of about fifteen years the rings are
widely open, as they were in 1855, 1869, and 1885, and will
be in 1899. At similar intervals they are rendered invisible,
being turned edgeways to the Earth, as in 1848, 1862, 1877,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
and 1891. Since 1877 the S. side of the rings has been
presented to terrestrial observers; but in 1893 the N. side
will come under inspection, and remain in view until 1907.
The S. side of the rings is obviously more favourably visible
to observers in England and other N. latitudes, because the
planet is always above the equator and attains a fair altitude
when it is presented. The N. side of the rings is exposed
when Saturn is in S. declination, and therefore more liable to
our atmospheric disturbances owing to his comparatively low
altitude. The extreme narrowness of the rings is apparent at
the periods when the planet crosses the node and they are
situated in the plane of the line of sight. In small telescopes
they become invisible, and the finest instruments only exhibit
them as thread-like extensions from the equator of the planet.
Sir J. Herschel says that on April 29, 1833, the disappearance
of the ring was <em>complete</em> when observed with a reflector of
18 inches aperture and 20 feet focal length. It remained
visible in 1862 as a broken line of light. At such times the
satellites are seen as bright beads, threading their way along
the narrow wavering line of the belts. Inequalities have been
observed at such times; for the line of light into which the
rings are then resolved is not uniform in breadth, but appears
broken and undulatory, as though indicating a very rugged
character of surface.</p>

<p>Sir J. Herschel estimated the thickness of the rings as
250 miles, but Bond thought it far less—about 40 miles.
There are great obstacles in the way of ascertaining the
exact proportions of a structure so distant and offering such
an extremely slender form to our view.</p>

<p><i>Further Observations required.</i>—The globe and rings of
Saturn offer an encouraging prospect for additional discoveries.
Though the more prominent details have already
been descried, there remain other features, probably of more
delicate outline and intermittent visibility, which will be
glimpsed in future years. Small instruments will scarcely
be competent to deal efficiently with this object: observers
who can command at least a moderate grasp of light may,
however, enter upon the work with every assurance of interesting
results. In this, as in other sections of observational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
astronomy, the student will realize that in oft-repeated observation
and comparison of records and drawings he acquires a
familiarity with the appearance of the object which will enable
him to discern more and more of its configuration, until
ultimately he feels confident he has progressed as far as the
utmost capacity of his instrument will permit. It is in the
sedulous application of his powers that the observer will find
the key to success. Partial devotion to a subject offers a
prospect far less encouraging; for observations of a disconnected
character are seldom valuable.</p>

<p>Changes are unquestionably occurring both in connection
with the ball and rings of Saturn<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>. Some of the discrepancies
between the observations published from time to time
are only to be explained on this assumption. It should
therefore be the aim of observers to obtain further evidence of
such variations, and this may be best accomplished by assiduously
watching the lineaments of the planet during the most
favourable periods of each opposition. The collection of a
number of reliable materials through a series of years would
undoubtedly possess weight in removing some of the anomalies
of past observation, and afford us a more thorough knowledge
of the delicate markings.</p>

<p>The rotation-period of Saturn is probably not much different
from that given by the atmospheric markings seen by Herschel
and Hall. But additional determinations are very desirable for
many reasons. The spots which are so plentiful on Mars and
Jupiter have furnished observers with a valid and concise
means of ascertaining the rate of axial motion of those planets.
Saturn, however, has far more sparingly provided the data for
such an investigation; for if we disregard Schröter’s uncertain
figures, we have but two values for the rotation-period. These
were fortunately effected by observers of exceptional ability,
and the periods may be accepted without reservation; but
other independent determinations are much required. By
multiplying results of this nature, we have a prolific source<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of comparison; and comparisons, apart from being interesting,
are of importance in denoting erratic results and indicating
those entitled to credence. Moreover, a reliable mean value
may be sometimes deduced from multiple records; hence
it becomes advisable to secure as many as possible.</p>

<p>The planet should be frequently examined during every
opposition with the highest powers that are consistent with a
perfectly distinct image; and the observer should closely scan
the various parts of the disk, with an endeavour to trace
spots, breaks, or other irregularities in the belts. Certain
inequalities of tone have been occasionally apparent in past
years, and they will doubtless reappear. The recovery of
these features will form a welcome addition to our knowledge,
and, if adequately observed, will enable the rotation-period
of the planet to be rediscussed. In an enquiry of this
kind many observations are needful, and the longer the interval
over which they extend the more accurate the results derived
from them are likely to be. If a broken belt should appear
on Saturn, the time of its passing the planet’s central meridian
should be recorded, either by measurement or careful estimation,
and an ephemeris computed based on a rotation-period
of 10-1/4<sup>h</sup>, which is equal to a daily rate of nearly 843°.
Then it should be carefully looked for on subsequent evenings
at the times given in the ephemeris, and on every occasion
when re-observed its time of transit should be noted as at first.
As long as the break continues visible, so long ought it to be
kept in view and the times of its central passages tabulated.
It would be advisable in such a case to secure cooperation from
other observers, as more numerous observations would be sure
to accrue, so that, on the appearance of a marking such as that
alluded to, the discoverer will do well to announce it immediately
to other amateurs who are engaged upon planetary
work and most likely to assist him. A white or dark spot, or
any condensation on the belts, would of course serve the same
purpose as a broken belt. The nature of the object is not
necessarily to be considered, the main requirement being that
it is one of which the longitude admits of determination.
Markings on the belts, if they are ever discernible, must be
watched with corresponding assiduity for traces of motion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
and if such motion should betray itself, the object of the
observer will be to ascertain its rate.</p>

<p>With reference to the narrow division in the outer ring,
usually termed “Encke’s division,” astronomers would regard
it as a gratifying advance could the doubts overhanging this
feature be removed. Is it a real division in the ring, or
simply a pencil-line of shading on the flat surface? Is it
constant in place and appearance, or does it frequently exhibit
changes both as to intensity and position? Judging from
prior experiences, this particular object would appear to be
extremely fugitive, and incapable of being assigned either a
definite place or aspect. Yet the more pronounced and well-attested
details of Saturn show no such vagaries: Cassini’s
division seems invariable. Are we therefore to surmise that
the curious behaviour of Encke’s division is to be referred to
errors of observation arising from the effects of unsteady air
upon a very delicate object? It is for future observers to
answer these questions, and this will entail no ordinary effort,
for the same impediments will be encountered in the future
as in the past. But fortunately our science is rapidly progressive,
and there is no doubt the mystery of Encke’s
division will find-its solution before long. A powerful telescope,
and a keen and continuous study of the outer ring,
will enable some discriminating observer to tell us the true
story of its phenomena.</p>

<p>Many other points in the Saturnian system require renewed
attention, but some of them appear to be so doubtful as to
scarcely deserve mention. Possibly the student had better
commence his review of the planet without any of the bias or
prejudice which former observations might occasion. But it
is as well to know the true state of the case; for the judgment
of a careful observer is not likely to be warped by preconception,
and of course some of the doubtful observations
may be amply verified at a future time. Several of these
have already been briefly referred to, and a few others may
here be noted. The form of the shadow thrown on the rings
from the ball has been observed of a curious shape, and
M. Trouvelot supposes it to be variable and occasioned by
changes on the level surface of the rings. The same observer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
has noticed transverse notches in the edges of the inner
bright ring. Evidence of variation is not entirely wanting
in regard to the chief division, and observers should notice
whether it appears uniformly black, as it has been suggested
that a gauze ring fills the interval. Exterior to the outer
ring a faint luminosity has also been suspected, as though the
phenomenon of the inner ring had its counterpart here. The
colour of the belts on the ball should be ascribed by careful
estimates, as many such observations may give an insight
into the variations occurring. Some observers have alleged
that the transparent ring of Bond and Dawes is subject
to very perceptible alterations. It must be remembered,
however, that the visible aspect of this exceedingly delicate
structure is much affected by the condition of the atmosphere,
and that the inclination of the Saturnian system must
obviously introduce changes. When the inclination is considerable,
the globe of the planet may be discerned through
this ring with greater effect than at other times, because we
have to look through a thinner stratum of its material.</p>

<p>The observer, in seeking to elucidate some of the anomalies
of former researches, will possibly himself gain a knowledge
of features not hitherto recognized. Of the real existence of
these he should assure himself by many critical observations
before venturing to announce them.</p>

<p>We have hinted that further discoveries upon Saturn may
be considered as practically beyond the reach of small telescopes;
but the gratifying fact remains that some of the
more noteworthy of the known features are visible in glasses
of little pretention as regards size. With a 2-inch refractor,
power about 90, not only are the rings splendidly visible, but
Cassini’s division is readily glimpsed, as well as the narrow
dark belt on the body of the planet. This sufficiently proves
that a very small and portable instrument is capable of
affording some excellent views of one of the most wonderful
objects in the heavens. Grover has seen, with an aperture
similar to that named, not only the belts and the shadow of
the ball on the rings, but two of the satellites as well; and
others may be equally successful.</p>

<p><i>Occultations of Saturn by the Moon.</i>—Phenomena of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
kind were well observed in England on May 8, 1859, April 20
and Sept. 30, 1870. Those of 1859 and Sept. 30, 1870, were
observed by the Rev. S. J. Johnson, who noted that “the
dull hue of the planet contrasted strikingly with the brilliant
yellow of the Moon.” Dawes witnessed the occultation in
1859, and saw the opaque edge of our satellite sharply defined
on the ball and rings of Saturn, without the slightest distortion
of form. No dark shading was remarked by him contiguous
to the Moon’s bright edge at the reappearance, such as he
and others had observed on Jupiter on the occasion of his
occultation, Jan. 2, 1857. Saturn was described as of a pale
greenish hue, and offered a strong contrast to the brilliant
yellow lustre of the Moon. On the early morning of April 20,
1870, several observers were on the <i lang="la">qui vive</i> for this interesting
occurrence; and their experiences are reported in the ‘Monthly
Notices R. A. S.’ vol. xxx. p. 175 <i>et seq.</i>, from which the following
are brief extracts:—</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis:—“The light of the planet, by contrast with the
Moon, was very faint.” Mr. Carpenter:—“There was not
the least alteration in the planet’s form.” Capt. Noble:—“Saturn
appeared of a richly-greenish yellow when compared
with the brilliant white light of the Moon.” Mr. G. C.
Talmage:—“The difference in colour between Saturn and
the Moon was most marked, the planet appearing of a yellow
tint.” Mr. J. Carpenter:—“At disappearance the planet
was a very dull object when in contact with the Moon; its
light probably a twentieth as bright. At reappearance the
planet was rather tremulous; no distortion was noticed.”
On June 13, 1870, the Rev. J. Spear, of Bengal, watched the
Moon pass “steadily over the planet without causing any
change of form or giving any indication of the planet’s light
passing through an atmospheric medium. When near the
Moon’s limb Saturn assumed a sickly green hue.”</p>

<p>I observed the occultation of Sept. 30, 1870, at Bristol,
with a 4-1/4-inch refractor; but the event offered no novel
traits, the most prominent feature being the difference of
brightness in the Moon and Saturn. Mr. C. L. Prince
observed this event with a Tulley refractor of 6·8 inches
aperture, power 250. He says there was not the slightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
distortion of either body, but he noticed that “the edge
of the ring lingered somewhat upon the Moon’s limb about
the time of disappearance.”</p>

<p>Another occultation occurred soon after new Moon on
April 9, 1883, and one of the observers, Mr. Loomis, described
the disappearance of the rings as a spectacle of great
interest, and said the impression was forcibly conveyed to his
mind that the Moon was very much nearer to the eye than
Saturn.</p>

<p><i>The Satellites.</i>—The discovery of the eight moons of this
planet ranged over the long period of 193 years. Five
different observers share the honours between them. Our
knowledge of the Saturnian satellites may almost be said to
furnish us with a history of improvements in the telescope;
for they were severally detected at epochs corresponding to
instrumental advances. The following are the periods, distances,
&amp;c. of the satellites:—</p>

<p class="hang small">(The arrows in the diagram show the direction of the motion of the

of last East elongation.)</p></blockquote>


<p>Titan is by far the largest satellite, being equal to a star of
the 8th mag. and visible in any small telescope. Iapetus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
ranks next, ordinarily about 9th mag., but there are variations
at different parts of the orbit similar to the variations which
affect the satellites of Jupiter; a variegated surface, and the
effects of rotation, originate the changes observed and give
strong support to the inference that this satellite rotates in
the same period that it revolves round its primary. Tethys,
Dione, and Rhea are fainter, and the difficulty of seeing them
is intensified by their proximity to the planet; but a good
4-inch refractor will reveal them on a clear dark night. The
others are objects for powerful instruments and pellucid
skies; but Enceladus is sometimes seen with moderate
aperture. The planet being usually much inclined, his
satellites are dispersed round about the rings, and are not
easy of identification. Minute stars lying near the path
of Saturn are very liable to be mistaken for them. But the
ephemerides drawn up by Mr. Marth, and published annually
by the Royal Astronomical Society, are of the utmost service
to amateurs engaged in these observations. By simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
reference they may readily identify the individual satellites
on any night; and these ephemerides are additionally useful
as giving the times of conjunctions of some of the satellites
with the ends of the ring and N. and S. points of the ball.</p>

<p>When the thin side of the rings is presented to the Earth,
transits and other phenomena may be observed in connection
with the Saturnian moons; but they appear to have been
rarely recorded. Sir W. Herschel describes a “beautiful
observation of the transit of the shadow of Titan over the
disk in 1789, November 2.” It was also seen in 1833 and
1862. The late Mr. Capron re-observed it on Dec. 10, 1877,
with a 8-1/4-inch reflector, power 144, and made the following
sketch:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_42"></a>Fig. 42.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(40).jpg"  alt="The sketch"  />
</div>

<p>These shadow-transits admit of easy observation with
appliances of very moderate capacity. Mr. Banks witnessed
a phenomenon of the kind with a refractor of only 2-7/8 inches,
and says it was watched with the same facility and ease as
the shadow of Sat. I. on Jupiter.</p>

<p>In looking for Iapetus it must be remembered that it is
commonly situated at a great distance from the planet. Titan
is relatively much nearer, and will always be recognized
without trouble. Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea hover
near the outskirts of the ring; while Mimas is extremely
close to it.</p>

<p>Prof. Hall, with the great Washington refractor, has
effected many valuable measures of this system in recent years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
He finds the orbits of the five inner satellites are sensibly
circular, and that they are situated in the plane of the rings.
Hyperion revolves in a very eccentric orbit, and this satellite
may approach very near to Titan. He obtained an observation
on March 25, 1885, which seems pertinent to the question of
variation in the light of the satellites. He says:—“Mimas
was remarkably bright, and could not be missed even when
the full light of the planet was admitted to the eye. Generally
this satellite is a difficult object, and from the ease with
which it is occasionally seen one might think it variable; but
I think the difference is due to the quality of the image.”
There is no doubt that this is the main cause of many assumed
changes in celestial objects, and especially in regard to those
of a minute and delicate character.</p>

<p><i>Occultations of Stars.</i>—Stars are rarely observed to be
occulted by Saturn. Webb mentions that, in 1707 or 1708,
Dr. Clark noticed a star in the interval between the ball and
rings; and Dawes once remarked a star of 8·5 mag. disappear
behind the outer edge of the exterior ring. It would be
extremely interesting to watch a tolerably conspicuous star
pass centrally behind the Saturnian system, and to trace it
through Cassini’s division and the transparent ring, noting
any changes in magnitude or appearance as they occurred.</p>

<p><i>Discovery.</i>—While Sir W. Herschel was a musician at Bath
he formed the design of making a telescopic survey of the
heavens. When engaged in this he accidentally effected a
discovery of great importance, for on the night of March 13,
1781, an object entered the field of his 6·3-inch reflector which
ultimately proved to be a new major planet of our system.
The acute eye of Herschel, directly it alighted upon the
strange body, recognized it as one of unusual character, for
it had a perceptible disk, and could be neither fixed star nor
nebula. He afterwards found the object to be in motion, and
its appearance being “hazy and ill-defined” with very high
powers he was led to regard it as a comet, and communicated
his discovery to the Royal Society at its meeting on April 26,
1781. His paper begins as follows:—</p>

<p>“On Tuesday, March 13, 1781, between 10 and 11 in the
evening, while I was examining the small stars in the neighbourhood
of H Geminorum, I perceived one that appeared
visibly larger than the rest. Being struck with its uncommon
magnitude, I compared it to H Geminorum and the small star
in the quartile between Auriga and Gemini, and finding it so
much larger than either of them suspected it to be a comet....
The power I had on when I first saw the comet
was 227.”</p>

<p>The supposed “comet” soon came under the observation of
others, including Maskelyne the Astronomer Royal, and
Messier, the “Comet Ferret” of Paris. The latter, in a
letter to Herschel, said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>—“Nothing was more difficult than
to catch it, and I cannot conceive how you could have hit this
star or comet several times, for it was absolutely necessary
for me to observe it for several days in succession before I
could perceive that it was in motion.”</p>

<p><i>True character revealed.</i>—As observations began to accumulate
it was seen that a parabolic orbit failed to accommodate
them. Ultimately the secret was revealed. The only
orbit to represent the motion of the new body was found to
be an approximately circular one situated far outside the
path of Saturn, and the inference became irresistible that the
supposed “comet” must in reality be a new primary planet
revolving on the outskirts of the solar system. This conclusion
was justified by facts of a convincing nature, and its
announcement created no small excitement in the scientific
world. Every telescope was directed to that part of the
firmament which contained the new orb, and its pale blue
disk, wrapped in tiny proportions, was viewed again and
again with all the delight that so great a novelty could inspire.
From the earliest period of ancient history, no discovery
of the same kind had been effected. The Chaldæans were
acquainted with five major planets, in addition to the Earth,
and the number had remained constant until the vigilant eye
of Herschel enlarged our knowledge, and Saturn was relieved
as the sentinel planet going his rounds on the distant frontiers
of our system.</p>

<p>When the elements of the new body had been computed a
search was instituted amongst the records of previous observers,
and it was found that Herschel’s planet had been seen on
many occasions, but it had invariably been mistaken for a
fixed star. Flamsteed observed it on six occasions between
1690 and 1715, while Le Monnier saw it on 12 nights in the
years from 1750 to 1771, and it seems to have been pure
carelessness on the part of the latter which prevented him
from anticipating Herschel in one of the greatest discoveries
of modern times.</p>

<p>The name Uranus was applied to the new planet, though
the discoverer himself called it the <i>Georgium Sidus</i>, and there
were others who termed it “Herschel,” in honour of the man
through whose sagacity it had been revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p><i>Period &amp;c.</i>—Uranus revolves round the Sun in 30,687 days,
which very slightly exceeds 84 terrestrial years. His mean
distance from the Sun is 1,782,000,000 miles, but the interval
varies between 1,699 and 1,865 millions of miles. The apparent
diameter of the planet undergoes little variation; the
mean is 3″·6, but observers differ. His real diameter is
approximately 31,000 miles, and the polar compression about
1/13, though this value is not that found by all authorities.</p>

<p><i>Observations.</i>—The planet near opposition shines like a star
of the 6th magnitude, and is observable with the naked eye.
He emits a bluish light. While engaged in meteoric observations,
I have sometimes followed the planet with the naked
eye during several months, and noted the changes in his
position relatively to the stars near. It is clear from this that
Uranus admitted of detection before the invention of the
telescope.</p>

<p>A luminous ring, similar to that of Saturn, was at first
supposed to surround Uranus, and Herschel suspected the
existence of such a feature on several occasions; but it scarcely
survived his later researches, and modern observations have
finally disposed of it.</p>

<p>Lassell, when working with his 2-foot speculum at Malta,
thought he saw a spot near the centre of the planet’s disk,
but he considered this might possibly be due to an optical
illusion. In 1862, Jan. 29, he said:—“I received an impression
which I am unable to render certain of an equatoreal
dark belt.” In the early months of 1870, Mr. Buffham,
using a 9-inch “With” mirror, powers 212 and 320, saw
bright spots and zones on the planet, and inferred a rotation-period
of about 12 hours. On Jan. 16, 1873, when definition
was very good, no traces of any markings were visible in
Lord Rosse’s 6-foot reflector. In May and June 1883 Prof.
Young, having the advantage of the fine 23-inch refractor at
the Princeton Observatory, observed two faint belts, one on
each side of the equator, and much like the belts of Saturn.
On March 18, 1884, Messrs. Thollon and Perrotin, with the
14-inch equatoreal at Nice, remarked dark spots similar to
those on Mars, towards the centre of the disk, and a white
spot was seen on the limb. Two different tints were perceived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
the colour of the N.W. hemisphere being dark, and that of
the S.E. a bluish-white colour. In April observations were
continued, and the white spot was seen “rather as a luminous
band than a simple spot,” but it was most conspicuous near
the limb. The observers thought the appearances indicated
a rotation-period of about 10 hours. The brothers Henry at
Paris, in 1884, invariably noticed two belts lying parallel to
each other, and including between them the brighter equatoreal
zone of the planet. Their results apparently show that
the angle between the plane of the Uranian equator and that
of the satellite-orbits is about 41°.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_43"></a>Fig. 43.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(41).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Uranus and his Belts. 1884.</div>
</div>

<p>M. Perrotin, with the great 30-inch equatoreal at Nice, re-observed
the belts in May and June 1889. He wrote that
dark parallel bands were noticed several times, and they were
very similar to the belts of Jupiter. On May 31 and June 1
and 7 the direction of the Uranian belts was measured, and
the mean result showed that the plane of the equator of
Uranus differs little (about 10°) from the common plane of
the orbits of the satellites. This deduction is not, it will be
observed, consistent with that of the Brothers Henry at Paris,
who found a difference of 41°. M. Perrotin notes that the
bands of Uranus do not always present the same aspect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
They vary in size and number in different parts of their
circumference. This unequal distribution raises the hope
that by an attentive study of these bands it will be possible
to determine the duration of the planet’s rotation.</p>

<p><i>Further Observations required.</i>—In the case of an object so
faint and diminutive as Uranus, a powerful telescope is absolutely
required to deal with it effectively. A small instrument
will readily show the disk, and present the picture that
caught the eye of Herschel more than a century ago, but
considerable light and power must be at command if the
observer would enter upon a study of the planet’s surface-markings.
With my 10-inch reflector I have suspected the
existence of the belts, but under high powers the image is
too feeble to exhibit delicate forms of this character. It is
to be hoped that with the large telescopes now available at
various observatories, some attention will be given to this
planet, more especially with regard to the study of the belts
and determination of the rotation-period. Amateurs will
have little trouble in picking up Uranus; his position can be
learnt from an ephemeris and marked upon a star-map.
A little careful sweeping with a low power in the region
indicated will soon reveal the object sought for, and a higher
power may then be applied to expand the disk and render
identification certain.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned as an interesting point that some
fifty years after the discovery of Uranus by Sir W. Herschel
the planet was accidentally rediscovered by his son Sir John
Herschel, who mentioned the fact as follows in a letter to
Admiral Smyth, written on Aug. 8, 1830:—“I have just
completed two 20-foot reflectors, and have got some interesting
observations of the satellites of Uranus. The first sweep
I made with my new mirror I <em>rediscovered</em> this planet by its
<em>disk</em>, having blundered upon it by the merest accident for
19 Capricorni.” Had the father failed to detect this planet
in 1781, the discovery might therefore have been made by
the son half a century later.</p>

<p>Some spectroscopic observations of Uranus made in 1889
with Mr. Common’s 5-foot reflector, appear to show that the
planet “is to a large extent self-luminous.” But Mr. Huggins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
on June 3 seems to have obtained a different result (see
‘Monthly Notices,’ xlix. p. 404 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p><i>The Satellites.</i>—For many years it was supposed that
Uranus possessed six satellites, all of which were discovered
by Sir W. Herschel, but later observations proved that four
of these had no existence. They were small stars near the
planet. But two of Herschel’s satellites were fully corroborated,
and two new ones were discovered by Lassell and
Struve. The number of known satellites attending Uranus is
four, and it is probable that many others exist, though they
are too minute to be distinguished in the most powerful instruments
hitherto constructed. The following are the periods,
distances, &amp;c., of the known satellites:—</p>

<p>Titania and Oberon are the two brightest satellites, but
none of them can be seen except in large instruments. The
two outer ones are said to have been glimpsed in a 4·3-inch
refractor, but this feat is phenomenal, and certainly no criterion
of ordinary capacity. Sir J. Herschel found them
tolerably conspicuous in a reflector of 18 or 20 inches aperture,
and mentioned a test-object by which observers might
determine whether their telescopes were adequate to reveal
them. This test is a minute double star lying between the
stars β′ and β<sup>2</sup> Capricorni. The magnitudes are 15 and 16,
and distance 3″. Relatively to the satellites of Uranus this
faint double is a “splendid object.”</p>

<p>From observations with large modern instruments it
appears highly probable that the four known satellites, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
be considerably larger than any others which may be revolving
round the planet. A curious fact in connection with
these satellites is that their motions are retrograde.</p>

<p class="hang small">(The small circle in the above diagram represents the planet and is on the

<p><i>Discovery of Neptune.</i>—The leading incidents in the narrative
of the discovery of Uranus and Neptune present a
great dissimilarity—Uranus was discovered by accident,
Neptune by design. Telescopic power revealed the former,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
while theory disclosed the latter. In one case optical appliances
afforded the direct means of success, while in the other
the unerring precision of mathematical analysis attained it.
The telescope played but a secondary part in the discovery of
Neptune, for this instrument was employed simply to realize
or confirm what theory had proven.</p>

<p>Certain irregularities in the motion of Uranus could not be
explained but on the assumption of an undetected planet
situated outside the known boundaries of the system. Two
able geometers applied themselves to study the problem of
these irregularities, and to deduce from them the place of the
disturbing body. This was effected independently by Messrs.
Le Verrier and Adams; and Dr. Galle, of Berlin, having received
from Le Verrier the leading results of his computations,
and the intimation that the longitude of the suspected planet
was then 326°, found it with his telescope on the night of
Sept. 23, 1846, in longitude 326° 52′. The calculated place
by Prof. Adams was 329° 19′ for the same date and less
accurate than the prediction of Le Verrier. The former had
priority both in attacking the problem and resolving it, though
unfortunately his efforts were not backed up in a practical
way. But for the supineness of certain officials, there is
little doubt that the planet would have been telescopically
discovered in the autumn of 1845, when it was within
1° 49′ of the place attributed to it by Prof. Adams. Delays
occurred owing to the doubts prevailing, and in the meantime
the planet was found elsewhere. This circumstance does not
rob Prof. Adams of his hard-earned laurels, though it shows
how seriously official negligence can mar the character of a
discovery.</p>

<p><i>Observations in 1795.</i>—The name given to the new planet
was Neptune. When the elements were computed it was
found that they presented rather large differences with those
theoretically computed by Messrs. Le Verrier and Adams.
It was also found that the planet had been previously
observed by Lalande on May 8 and 10, 1795, but its true
character escaped detection. This astronomer had observed a
star of the 8th mag. on May 8; but on May 10, not finding
the same star in the exact place noted on the former evening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
he rejected the first observation as inaccurate and adopted the
second, marking it doubtful. Had Lalande exercised a little
discretion, and confided in his work, he would hardly have
allowed the matter to rest here. A subsequent observation
would at once have exhibited the cause of the discrepancy,
and the mathematical triumph of Le Verrier and Adams, half
a century later, would have been forestalled. Lalande, like
Le Monnier, the unsuspecting observer of Uranus, let a valuable
discovery slip through his hands.</p>

<p><i>Period &amp;c.</i>—Neptune revolves round the Sun in 60,126
days, which is equal to rather more than 164½ of our years.
His mean distance from the Sun is 2,792,000,000 miles, and
his usual diameter 2″·7. He exceeds Uranus in dimensions,
his real diameter being 37,000 miles.</p>

<p><i>Observations.</i>—Our knowledge of this distant orb is extremely
limited, owing to his apparently diminutive size and
feebleness. No markings have ever been sighted on his
miniature disk, and we can expect to learn nothing until one
of the large telescopes is employed in the work. No doubt
this planet exhibits the same belted appearance as that of
Uranus, and there is every probability that he possesses a
numerous retinue of satellites. In dealing with an object
like this small instruments are useless; they will display the
disk, and enable us to identify the object and determine its
position if necessary, but beyond this their powers are
restricted by want of light.</p>

<p><i>Supposed Ring.</i>—Directly the new planet was discovered,
Mr. Lassell turned his large reflector upon it and sought to
learn something of its appearance, and possibly detect one or
more of its satellites. On October 3 and 10, 1846, he was
struck with the appearance of the disk, which was obviously
not perfectly spherical. He subsequently confirmed this
impression, and concluded that a ring, inclined about 70°,
surrounded the planet. Prof. Challis supported this view,
but later observations in a purer sky led Mr. Lassell to
abandon the idea. Thus the ring of Neptune, like the ring of
Uranus, though apparently obvious at first, vanished in the
light of more modern researches.</p>

<p><i>The Satellite.</i>—But if Mr. Lassell quite failed to demon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>strate
the existence of a ring, he nevertheless succeeded in
discovering a satellite belonging to the planet. This was on
Oct. 10, 1846. The new satellite was found to have a period
of 5<sup>d</sup> 21<sup>h</sup> 3<sup>m</sup>, and to be situated about 220,000 miles distant
from the planet. Its apparent star mag. is 14, and at max.
elongation it extends its excursions to 18″ on either side of
its primary. Compared with the other satellites of our system
the one attending Neptune must be excessive in regard to
size, or it could not be discerned at the vast distance separating
it from the Earth.</p>

<p class="hang small">(The small circle in the above diagram represents the planet, the arrows
show the direction of motion, and the figures indicate the interval
from the time of last North-east elongation.)</p></blockquote>


<p><i>A trans-Neptunian Planet.</i>—Is there a planet beyond
Neptune? Prof. Forbes wrote a memoir in 1880 tending
to prove that two such planets exist. From the influences
exerted by these bodies on certain comets of long period,
he approximately deduced the positions of the former, and
they were searched for with the great Washington refractor,
but without success. Flammarion and Todd have also arrived
at conclusions affirming the existence of a planet outside
Neptune; but the idea has not yet been realized by its
telescopic discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p><i>Planetary Conjunctions.</i>—Before concluding this chapter,
an allusion should be made to a noteworthy class of events,
viz., planetary conjunctions. These include some of the most
attractive aspects displayed by the heavenly bodies, and they
are sometimes witnessed by ordinary persons with the same
amount of gratification as by the astronomical amateur. In
almanacks the times of such conjunctions are given, so that
intending observers may always be prepared for these events.
In a strict sense a conjunction occurs at the instant when two
or more bodies have the same right ascension, but the term is
here intended to have a more general reference, <i>i. e.</i>, to denote
the assembling together of two or more planets in the same
region of the firmament. Historical records furnish us with
a considerable number of planetary conjunctions, and some of
them were attentively observed long before the telescope came
into use. Thus in 2012 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, Feb. 26, the Moon, Mercury,
Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn were in the same constellation,
and within 14° of one another. In 1186 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, Sep. 14, the
Sun, Moon, and all the known planets are said to have been
situated in Libra. In 1524 Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
were near together. Many similar instances might be quoted,
but this is unnecessary. Occasionally the conjunctions were
so close that one planet appeared to occult another. Kepler
refers to an occultation of Jupiter by Mars which he saw on
January 9, 1591; but this would really be a transit of Mars
across the disk of Jupiter, if contact actually occurred, for the
apparent diameter of Jupiter always exceeds that of Mars.
Mœstlin seems to have witnessed an occultation of Mars by
Venus on Oct. 3, 1590. It is probable, however, that these
were near approaches only. A genuine occultation of Mercury
by Venus was telescopically observed on May 17,
1737.</p>

<p>On the evening of March 3, 1881, the new Moon, Venus,
Jupiter, and Saturn formed a brilliant quartet in Pisces. On
the morning of July 21, 1881, I saw the Moon, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, and Aldebaran in the same region above the
eastern horizon. There was a very close conjunction of Mars
and Saturn on the morning of Sept. 20, 1889. Mr. Marth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>computed that the nearest approach would occur at 8<sup>h</sup> 7<sup>m</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>,
when the distance between the centres would be 54″·8 and less
than that (74″) observed at the time of the close conjunction
of the same planets on June 30, 1879.</p>

<p>The interest centred in the conjunction of Sept. 20, 1889,
was enhanced by the fact that Regulus was only 47′ distant,
while Venus was also in the same region. I observed this
phenomenon in my 10-inch reflector, and with the help of a
comet-eyepiece made the above sketch of the positions of the
objects as they were presented in the field.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_46"></a>Fig. 46.</div>

<div class="caption">Mars, Saturn, and Regulus in same field, Sept. 20 1889, 4<sup>h</sup> 45<sup>m</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps there is not much scientific importance attached
to the observation of these conjunctions, though comparisons
of colour and surface-brilliancy are feasible at such epochs,
and are not wholly without value. As spectacles merely,
they possess a high degree of interest to everyone who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
“considers the heavens.”</p>

<p>Superstitious ideas with regard to comets as the harbingers
of disaster have long since been discarded for more rational
opinions. They are no longer looked upon as ill-omened
presages of evil, or as</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent16">“From Saturnius sent,</div>
  <div class="verse">To fright the nations with a dire portent.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Many references are to be found among old writings to the
supposed evil influence of these bodies, and to the dread which
their appearance formerly incited in the popular mind. Shakespeare
makes an allusion to the common belief:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</div>
  <div class="verse">Comets, importing change of time and states,</div>
  <div class="verse">Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and in relation to the habit of connecting historical events
with their apparition, he further says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“When beggars die, there are no comets seen;</div>
  <div class="verse">The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But, happily, the notions prevalent in former times have been
superseded by the more enlightened views naturally resulting
from the acquirement and diffusion of knowledge; so that
comets, though still surrounded by a good deal of mystery, are
now regarded with considerable interest, and welcomed, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
only as objects devoid of malevolent character, but as furnishing
many useful materials for study. Mere superstition has been
put aside as an impediment to real progress, and a more
intelligent age has recognized the necessity of dealing only
with <em>facts</em> and explaining them according to the laws of
nature; for it is on facts, and their just interpretation, that
all true searchers after knowledge must rely. Comets are
properly regarded as bodies which, though far from being
thoroughly understood in all the details of their physical
structure and behaviour, have yet a wonderful history, and
one which, could it be clearly elucidated, would unfold some
new and marvellous facts. Under these circumstances we
need evince no surprise that these visitors are invariably
hailed with enthusiasm, not only by scientific men, who
make them the special subjects of close observation, but by
everyone who regards celestial “sights and signs” with
occasional attention.</p>

<p><i>Appearance.</i>—From whatever point of view a large comet
is considered, it deserves all the interest manifested in it and
all the labour expended in its investigation. Whilst its
grand appearance in the firmament arrests the notice of all
classes alike, and is the subject of much curious speculation
amongst the uninformed, it merits, apart from other considerations,
the most assiduous observation on account of the
singular features it displays and the striking variations they
undergo. Indeed, the visible deportment of a comet during
its rapid career near perihelion is so extraordinary as to form
a problem, the solution of which continues to defy the most
ingenious theories. The remarkable changes in progress, the
quickness and apparent irregularity of their development, are
the immediate result of a combination of forces, the operations
of which can neither be defined nor foreseen. Jets of flame
and wreaths of vapour start from the brilliant nucleus; while,
streaming away from the latter, in a direction opposite to the
Sun, is the fan-shaped tail, often traceable over a large span
of the heavens and commingling its extreme fainter limits
with the star-dust in the background.</p>

<p><i>Large number visible.</i>—The orbits of 400 comets have now
been computed, and more than 500 others have been ob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>served;
so that these bodies are extremely plentiful. Kepler
described them to be as numerous as the fishes in the sea, and
no doubt the allegory is justly applied. Their vagaries of
form, size, and place are equally noteworthy; and those who
enter upon the discussion of facts relating to these objects will
find an endless store of interesting materials, opening up a
wide field for conjecture.</p>

<p><i>Nature of Apparition.</i>—The apparition of a comet may be
either gradual or sudden. Usually the telescope gives us the
earliest intimation that one of these bodies is approaching us<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>.
It is first seen as a small round nebulosity, with probably a
central condensation or stellar nucleus of the 10th or 11th mag.
The whole object brightens and expands as its distance grows
less, and it assumes an elongated form preparatory to the
formation of a tail. The latter varies greatly in different
instances: it may either be a narrow ray, as shown in the
southern comet of January 1887, or a fan-shaped extension
like that of the great comet of 1744. Barnard’s Comet of
December 1886 exhibited a duple tail. Occasionally a fine
comet bursts upon us suddenly, like that of 1843 or 1861.
The former was sufficiently bright to be discovered when only
4° from the Sun, and the latter presented itself quite unexpectedly
as a magnificent object even in the strong twilight
of a June sky.</p>

<p><i>Tenuity of Comets.</i>—Comets are noteworthy for the extreme
thinness of their material. The smallest stars may be discerned
through the denser portions of the head, without suffering any
apparent diminution of light. Yet such stars would be quite
obscured by the interposition of a minute speck of cloud or by
a little fog or any vapour of trifling density. Comets are visible
in the form of transparent nebulosities; and their mass must
be inconceivably small relatively to the enormous space over
which they frequently extend. Sir J. Herschel has described
the “all but spiritual texture” of comets; and other authorities
have referred to them as feeble wreaths of vapour,
which, though obeying the laws of gravitation and suffering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
much perturbation, are yet themselves incapable of exercising
any disturbing influence upon the other bodies near which
they pass. It has been asserted that comets would show
phases were they rendered luminous by reflected sunlight,
and that, such features being absent, these bodies must
possess a phosphorescence of their own sufficient to cause the
glow observed. This idea, however, is hardly consistent
with our present knowledge. Comets are not compact and
coherent masses of matter; they more likely represent vast
groups of planetary atoms, more or less loosely dispersed and
sometimes forming streams. The effect of sunshine upon
such assemblages will be that the whole mass becomes illumined
according to density, and that no phase will be apparent,
inasmuch as the light is enabled to penetrate through its
entirety.</p>

<p><i>Differences of Orbit.</i>—When three trustworthy observations
of a comet’s place have been made, its orbit may be computed.
This may be either an ellipse, a parabola, or hyperbola. If an
<em>ellipse</em> the comet is periodical, and the period depends upon
the degree of eccentricity. If a <em>parabola</em> the comet will not
be seen again, because this form of orbit does not reunite;
it consists of branches equally divergent and uniting at perihelion,
but extending outwards indefinitely in nearly parallel
lines and without convergence. If a <em>hyperbola</em>, the comet is
also not returnable; the branches of the orbit are widely
divergent, and show no tendency to parallelism. These
several forms of orbit are somewhat different as applied to
various comets, but they are the same in effect. Thus
Tempel’s Comet of 1867 revolves in an ellipse having an
eccentricity of about 0·4630, while that of Halley’s Comet is
0·9674. No doubt some of the parabolic orbits applied to
comets really represent very eccentric ellipses; but the
parabola is a convenient form of orbit for computation,
and unless ellipticity is very decided it indicates the path
with sufficient accuracy.</p>

<p><i>Discoveries of Comets.</i>—In the latter part of the last century
Messier, Mechain, and Miss Herschel shared nearly all the
cometary discoveries between them. Then Pons entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
field, and he may be said to have monopolized this branch
during the period from 1802 to 1827, for he was the first to
announce thirty comets. Pons died in 1831, but the search
was actively continued by others. In about 1843 a great rise
became apparent in the rate of these discoveries; and we
find Di Vico, Mauvais, and Brorsen very successful at this
period. Later on, the work was sustained with the same
prolific results by Klinkerfues, Bruhns, and Donati, and
subsequently by Winnecke, Tempel, and Coggia. Swift
and Borrelly also assisted materially to swell our knowledge;
while during the last few years Barnard and Brooks have
exhibited a surprising amount of zeal in this department.
Since 1881 no less than twenty-six comets are to be enumerated
as the fruits of their endeavours, and they are still
engaged in nightly explorations of the sky with similar ends
in view. Their diligent pursuit of these fugitive bodies will
doubtless result in many further additions during ensuing
years.</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance that Sir W. Herschel, during
all his star-gaugings and sweeps for nebulæ, never discovered a
comet. He found a nebula on Dec. 18, 1783, near δ Ceti, which
he described as “small and cometic.” In Sir J. Herschel’s
‘General Catalogue of Nebulæ,’ 1864, p. 17, this object is
presumed to have been a comet, as it could not be identified;
but at p. 45 the doubts are cleared up, and Sir W. Herschel’s
nebula, the position of which was only roughly given, is
shown to be the same as another very near; it is No. 1055 of
the new ‘General Catalogue’ published by the Royal Astronomical
Society in January 1888. Quite possibly Sir W.
Herschel’s lists of nebulæ contain several comets, as some of
his objects are missing; but errors of observation in ascribing
positions may explain this. Herschel himself, in speaking of
a comet visible in the winter of 1807-8, says:—“If I had
met the comet in one of my sweeps, as it appeared between
Dec. 6 and Feb. 21, I should have put it down as a
nebula. Perhaps my lists of nebulæ, then, contain some
comets.”</p>

<p><i>Large Comets.</i>—The most widely observed and attractive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
class of comets includes those of large proportions, as they are
not only visible to the naked eye, but exhibit features having
the lustre necessary to permit of their examination with high
magnifying powers. A brief summary of some of the finest
comets of modern times is subjoined; but, to save space,
a few only of the more salient facts concerning them are
given:—</p>

<p>1577, Nov. and Dec.—Observed by Tycho Brahe. At the
end of November it had a double tail; the longest of the two
branches was about 20°. This comet was visible in the daytime.</p>

<p>1618 II., Nov.—“The length of its tail equalled in extent
one sixth part of the zodiac.” On Nov. 18 it was estimated
as 40°. Longomontanus, however, described it as 104° long,
and Cysatus estimated it as 75°. Kepler referred to it as the
largest comet that had appeared for a hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>1680, Dec.—A fine comet, which on Dec. 12 had a narrow
tail about 80° long. The nucleus was equal to a 1st mag.
star. Hooke remarked jets of flame issuing from the nucleus.
At perihelion the comet approached very near the Sun’s
surface, similarly to the fine comets of 1843, 1880, and 1882.</p>

<p>1744, Jan.-Feb.—Probably the largest comet of the 18th
century. At one time it displayed six tails, each of which
was 4° in breadth. The head was so bright that it was perceived
with the naked eye in full sunshine. At the middle of
February the tail was 24° long, and it was divided into two
branches.</p>

<p>1769, Sept.—Discovered on Aug. 8 by Messier. On
Aug. 30 the comet had a trifid tail; there was a central
ray of 24° and two outlying ones of 4° each. On Sept. 19
the tail had increased to 75°, and a few nights later Pingre
estimated it as 90° and 97°.</p>

<p>1811 I., Sept.-Oct.—A very fine comet. The tail was
branched; it did not, however, exceed 25° in length and
about 6° in breadth. Sir W. Herschel found the nucleus to
be 428 miles in diameter. This remarkable comet remained
visible during a period extending over seventeen months.
Its period is approximately 3000 years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>1843, Mar.—Visible in the daytime. On Mar. 4 its tail
was 69° in length; it was very narrow, being only 1-1/4° in
breadth throughout. At perihelion this object passed very
near to the Sun, like the great comet of 1680. it revolves in
an elliptical orbit; period about 376 years. This comet swept
past perihelion with a velocity of 366 miles per second!
The real length of its tail was 200 millions of miles!</p>

<p>1858 VI., Sept.-Oct.—Donati’s Comet: one of the most
brilliant comets of the 19th century. Early in October it
displayed a tail about 40° long, and on the 5th it passed over
the star Arcturus. Its period of revolution appears to be
about 2000 years.</p>

<p>1861 II., June-July.—Became suddenly visible at the end
of June. In the opinion of Sir John Herschel this comet
surpassed in grandeur the comets of 1811 and 1858. On
June 30 the nucleus was equal to the brightness of Venus,
and the tail was 80° long; but early in July it increased to
90°. One observer estimated its length as 100° on July 2.
This comet remained visible during twelve months. It
appears to have an elliptical orbit, with a period of 409 years.</p>

<p>1874, July.—Coggia’s Comet: a fine object in the northern
sky. On July 14 the tail was 35° long, and it remained visible
several days after the nucleus had disappeared below the
horizon. The nucleus was about equal to a star of the
1st mag. Orbit probably elliptical, with a period of about
5711 years.</p>

<p>1880 I., Jan.-Feb.—A southern comet, with a long narrow
tail, variously estimated from 30° to 40° in length. It passed
very near to the Sun, and presents an orbital resemblance to
the fine comets of 1680 and 1843.</p>

<p>1881 III., June-July.—This large comet appeared in the
northern heavens on June 22, and became generally visible
to observers in England. On the 27th it had a tail 15° long.
Its period of visibility extended over nine months.</p>

<p>1881 IV., Aug.—This comet is scarcely entitled to rank as
one of exceptional character; but it was a conspicuous object
for several weeks in August, and had a tail 6° long on the
19th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>1882 III., Oct.—Well visible in the morning sky, with a
tail 22° long. The nucleus underwent remarkable changes,
and on Oct. 23 it showed four or five bright points or nuclei,
looking like “a string of beads.” The comet threw off several
small condensations, which were observed as separate comets
near the parent mass. At perihelion this comet passed very
close to the Sun, like the comets of 1680, 1843, and 1880;
and these bodies were suspected to have an intimate relation,
if not an absolute identity. But subsequent inquiries disproved
this startling supposition; for the comet of 1882 was
shown to have a period of about 718 years.</p>

<p>1887 I., Jan.—A fine southern comet, presenting many
points of resemblance to that of 1880 I. On Jan. 22, as
observed at Adelaide, the comet had a long narrow tail of
about 30°, but no well-defined nucleus. On the same date, at
the Cape of Good Hope, the tail appeared as a narrow ribbon
of light, quite straight, and of nearly uniform brightness
throughout its length. It was visible in the same region
of the sky as the comet 1880 I., and came into view with
equal suddenness.</p>

<p><i>Periodical Comets.</i>—On page <a href="#Page_235">235</a> is a list of the periodical
comets as at present known. Some of these, marked with an
asterisk, have only been observed at one return, and therefore
await complete confirmation.</p>

<p>Many other comets have shown indications of pursuing
elliptical orbits. Amongst those of short period may be
mentioned 1743 I., 1766 II., 1783 I., 1819 IV., 1844 I., and
1873 VII. The following are examples of longer periods:—</p>

<p><i>Halley’s Comet.</i>—A fine comet with a tail about 15° long
appeared in the summer of 1682, and Halley computed the
orbit according to the method explained by Newton. He
then consulted observations of previous comets, and discovered
a great similarity in the paths of large comets seen
in 1531 and 1607 to that of the one he himself had observed
in 1682. He thereupon suspected the three bodies to be one
and the same, and advised posterity to maintain a strict watch
for the comet’s return in about 1758 or 1759. On pursuing
his investigations still further, he alighted upon records of
comets in 1305, 1380, and 1456, which greatly strengthened
his opinion that the comet of 1682 moved in an elliptical
path with a period of about 75½ years. He termed this body
“the Mercury<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> of comets, revolving round the Sun in the
smallest orbit,” and said that, should it reappear according to
his prediction in about the year 1758, “impartial posterity
must needs allow this to be the discovery of an Englishman.”</p>

<p>As the time drew near for the return of the comet, interest
became intensified, and computations were made by Clairaut
with a view to determine the precise epoch when it would
arrive at perihelion. He found that the comet would be
retarded by the action of Jupiter and Saturn, but that perihelion
would be reached at the middle of April 1759, subject
to an uncertainty of 30 days. The comet was rediscovered
on Dec. 25, 1758, by Palitzch, an amateur astronomer at
Politz, near Dresden, who employed a telescope of 8 feet
focal length, and appears to have anticipated Messier and
others who were on the alert for it. It arrived at perihelion
on March 12, 1759, and within a month of the date announced
by Clairaut. Early in May it had a tail nearly 50° long, and
presented a fine aspect in the heavens. Thus the sagacity of
Halley had revealed a periodical comet—the first known. It
duly returned again in 1835, and received all the attention
which a body so replete with historical associations deserved.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Encke’s Comet.</i>—Until the year 1819 Halley’s Comet was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
the only one certainly known to be periodical. Then the able
deductions of Encke presented us with a veritable “Mercury<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
of comets.” He showed that a small comet, discovered by
the unwearying Pons of Marseilles on Nov. 26, 1818, was
really identical with three previous comets—viz. 1786 I.
(Mechain), 1795 (C. Herschel), and 1805 (Thulis),—and that
its period was a very short one of about 3-1/3 years. Its return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
to perihelion was predicted to occur on May 24, 1822, and
this was observed in the southern hemisphere. It returned
again on Sept. 16, 1825, and on this occasion the circumstances
were more favourable. Since 1825 this object has effected
nineteen returns to perihelion, and one of the most singular
facts noticed in connection with it is that its period is gradually
shortening. In 1795 it was 1212 days, while in 1858
it was 1210. In order to explain this contraction of orbit, it
has been necessary to assume the existence of a thin medium
in space capable of affording a slight resistance to the tenuous
materials of a comet, though not dense enough to appreciably
affect the motions of planets. If this closing-up of the orbit
and shortening of period continue to operate through a vast
interval of time, Encke’s Comet must be ultimately precipitated
upon the Sun!<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p><i>Biela’s Comet.</i>—This comet was discovered on Feb. 27,
1826, by Wilhelm von Biela, an Austrian officer, at Josephstadt
in Bohemia, and ten days later by Gambart at Marseilles.
It was found to be revolving in an orbit of short
period, and its elements presented an agreement with those
of the comet of 1772 (Montaigne) and 1806 I. (Pons).
Identity was inferred, and the next return was fixed for
Nov. 27, 1832, when the object reappeared with great
punctuality. At the end of 1845 this comet displayed some
startling phenomena; for it divided into two portions, apparently
quite disconnected, and which travelled side by side,
separated by an interval of more than 150,000 miles! The
double comet was observed again in 1852, when the interval
separating them had, however, increased eightfold, for the
dark space between measured 1,250,000 miles. This instance
of a divided comet is by no means unique. The great comet
of 1882 underwent a process of disruption, by throwing off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
small masses of nebulosity, which, however, survived the
separation only a few days. Brooks’s Comet (1889 V.) was
found by Barnard, on Aug. 1, 1889, to be divided into four
parts! Two of these had a brief existence; but one of the
minor fragments retained a very distinct appearance near
the parent mass during the ensuing months of September and
October. The phenomena of Biela’s Comet found an excellent
counterpart here.</p>

</div>

<p>Since 1852 Biela’s Comet has been lost. The most assiduous
observations have failed to recover it, and the conclusion
seems irresistible that further disintegrations have
occurred and that its material has been dispersed beyond
recognition. The great meteoric storms of Nov. 27, 1872 and
1885, were derived from this comet, and there is little reason
to hope that <em>as a comet</em> it will ever be seen again.</p>

<p><i>Brorsen’s Comet.</i>—A small comet was discovered in Pisces
by Theodor Brorsen, at Kiel, on the evening of Feb. 26, 1846,
Its observed path soon gave traces of an elliptical orbit; and
the period was found to be about 5·58 years. The comet was
re-observed at its return to perihelion in 1857, 1868, 1873,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
and 1879; but in 1884 it was looked for in vain. This comet
was expected in February 1890, and several observers swept for
it diligently, but to no purpose. Are we, therefore, to regard
this as another lost member of our system? Has the comet of
Brorsen, like that of Biela, suffered dispersion in such degree
as to be no longer within the reach of our powerful telescopes?
Should negative results again attend observers in
1895, when the comet ought to return, there will be no reason
to doubt its actual disappearance. It may be mentioned that
owing to planetary perturbations, the period of this body has
rapidly become shorter since 1846. It was then 2034 days,
but in 1879 was reduced to 1995 days.</p>

<p><i>Faye’s Comet.</i>—First seen at the Paris Observatory on the
night of Nov. 22, 1843, when it was near the star Bellatrix
in Orion. The observations clearly proved the comet to be
moving in an elliptical path, and Dr. Goldschmidt of Göttingen
determined its period as 7½ years. It was re-observed in
1851, and also during each of its five subsequent returns, the
last of which occurred in August 1888. The orbit of this
body approaches nearer to the circular form than that of any
other known comet, except Tempel’s of 1867. Its perihelion
distance is considerable, for it never comes within the orbit of
Mars. Prof. Möller, of Lund, has investigated the path with
all the critical acumen of a profound mathematician, and,
chiefly owing to his labours, it is now regarded as one of the
best known members of our system.</p>

<p><i>D’Arrest’s Comet.</i>—Discovered at the Leipsic Observatory
on June 27, 1851. M. Villarceau discussed the orbit, and
announced it as an elliptic one with a periodic time of about
6½ years. The comet was redetected at its return in 1857-8,
1870, 1877, and 1890. It is a very faint object.</p>

<p><i>Pons-Winnecke’s Comet.</i>—Discovered at Bonn on March 8,
1858, and on the elements being computed they were found
nearly coincident with those of Pons’s Comet, 1819 III.
Encke had assigned a period of 5·62 years for the latter, but
it managed to escape observation during the six returns
that occurred in the 39 years between 1819 and 1858. Its
identity was fully established in 1869, when it was again
observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p><i>Tuttle’s Comet.</i>—A faint, diffused comet was discovered in
the northern part of Hercules by H. P. Tuttle, of Cambridge,
U.S.A., on Jan. 4, 1858. Its elements on being calculated
were found by Pape to be similar to those of a comet discovered
by Mechain on Jan. 9, 1790, and an elliptic orbit
with a period of 13·66 years was derived from the new observations.
On the assumption that the two bodies were one
and the same there must have occurred four unobserved
returns to perihelion between 1790 and 1858. The year 1871
was awaited in settlement of the question. When it came
the comet returned, and the predictions received exact verification.
Thus the comets of Mechain and Tuttle were placed
in the inseverable bonds of identity.</p>

<p>Of the other periodical comets it will be unnecessary to give
details. Some of them are still without full corroboration,
only one return to perihelion having been observed. The reappearance
of Pons’s Comet (1812) in 1883-4, and of Olbers’s
Comet (1815) in 1887 furnished two excellent examples of
well-determined comets belonging to the same class as that of
Halley. Tempel’s discoveries in 1867, 1869, and 1873
afforded some interesting additions to the family of short-period
comets, and the list of these is continually extending
owing to the assiduity of observers, though the lost comets of
Biela and Brorsen will have to be removed from it. Peters’s
Comet of 1846 is also doubtful, as it escaped rediscovery in
about 1859, 1872, and 1884; but this object may yet be captured
at one of its succeeding apparitions. These bodies often
evade redetection when their periods and paths are not accurately
known. This has been fully exemplified in the case of the
comets of Pons-Winnecke and Tuttle, which were unseen at
several consecutive returns. It has been supposed, and not
without reason, that the periodical comets are in process of
wearing away. They apparently grow fainter at each return.
Halley’s Comet in 1835 was only moderately bright, whereas
in ancient times its appearance was magnificent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p><i>Grouping of Periodical Comets.</i>—It is a curious circumstance
that these bodies are assorted into groups having their aphelia
near the orbits of major planets. The short-period comets
comprised within the orbits of Encke’s (3·29 years) and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
Denning’s (8·69 years) have aphelia in the region of the path
of Jupiter, hence they are occasionally referred to as Jovian
comets. The next group is represented by the comets of
Peters and Tuttle, with aphelia near Saturn. The third
group includes the comets of Tempel and Stephan, with aphelia
just outside the orbit of Uranus. The fourth group is shown
by the comets of Halley, Pons, and Olbers, with three others
less certainly ascertained, with aphelia exterior to Neptune.
There are unmistakable indications of other groups far outside
the known boundaries of the solar system, but these are
not so well defined. This clustering of cometary orbits has
been ascribed to the attractive influences of the large superior
planets, which are so capable of disturbing the paths of comets
passing near that the orbits become transformed, and the
aphelia henceforth lie near the points of extreme perturbation.
This has been called the “capture theory;” and there is also
an “ejection theory,” which supposes the periodical comets
to have had their birth in planetary ejections.</p>

<p>M. Hoek of Utrecht has found cases in which the orbits of
two or more comets exhibit a common point of intersection
in distant space, and infers their derivation from the same
origin.</p>

<p><i>Further Observations required.</i>—One of the chief and essential
features in cometary work is the accurate determination of
positions. But this entails the possession of expensive instruments,
and a knowledge which amateurs have not always
acquired. This department of labour can well be left to the
trained hands at large observatories, where, fortunately, it
meets with every attention. Ordinary observers will merely
require to know the approximate place, and this is to be
found by estimating the difference in R.A. and Dec. between
a comet and a known star. The position of the latter may be
found in a good catalogue and corrected for precession;
then, allowing for the observed differences, the comet’s place
may be assigned to within very small limits of error. A low
power, embracing a field of 1° or more, is best adapted for
these observations, as it is more likely to include a catalogued
star, and will exhibit the comet, especially if a large one, to
the best effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>The announcement of a new comet is always read with
avidity by amateurs, and their first desire is to see it for
themselves. This they may readily do by marking its place
on a star-map or globe, and noting its relative place amongst
the stars near. The telescope should then be directed towards
the point indicated, and if the comet is not presented in the
field, the instrument should be moved a little so that the surrounding
region may be examined. If failure still attends
the effort, the observer should point the telescope a few
degrees E. or W. of the suspected point, and then carefully
sweep over the place of the comet. It will then be picked up,
unless it is too faint for his aperture. The first announcement
of a comet generally gives the position at discovery, and
the daily rate and direction of motion. The latter must of
course be allowed for when the search is instituted.</p>

<p>The physical aspects of comets are as diversified as they
are variable. No two comets are exactly alike, nor does the
same comet exhibit a permanency of detail. Of course, when
these objects are enormously distant, and barely visible, many
of them appear to present similar characteristics; but under
the closer and more expanded views obtainable near perihelion
the resemblance vanishes, and every comet is seen to possess
features peculiar to itself. To trace these features, and to
record them by delineation and description, forms one of the
most interesting branches in which amateurs may engage.
Much has been learnt of previous comets by successively
noting their transitions of form and brightness, and the
same scrupulous attention should be given to future comets.</p>

<p>The tails of comets are not always turned away from the Sun.
Indeed, the contrary effect is sometimes produced. Occasionally
there is a duple tail, the largest branch of which follows
the normal direction, while the other is turned towards the
Sun. Forms of this character require close watching from
night to night. Is the sunward tail developed suddenly? and
has it a fairly durable existence? Instances of singular curvature
should also be noted. The tails are seldom perfectly
straight, especially those attached to naked-eye comets, and
decided changes affect their visible outlines at very short
intervals. In large comets the space over which the tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
extends should be sketched upon a star-map on successive
evenings; its changes of position and curve will then be manifested
by comparisons, and its increasing or decreasing
length will also be apparent. Dark rifts, like shadows, often
run lengthwise through the tail, and occasion a fan-like
appearance analogous to that which distinguished the great
comet of 1744 and gave it a sextuple tail.</p>

<p>The light of comets sometimes fluctuates in a very extraordinary
manner, and too rapidly and irregularly to be consistent
with theory. In this respect, Pons’s Comet, at its
last return in 1883-4 presented an eccentric behaviour.
Bigourdan found that during the nineteen days from Sept. 5
to 24, 1883, the increase in the comet’s brilliancy exceeded by
thirty or forty times that resulting from reflected light alone!
This increase appears to have been due to a sudden outburst
on Sept. 22, which occurred some time within the four hours
preceding midnight. Dr. Müller, of Potsdam, witnessed a
further outburst on Jan. 1, 1884, within 1-3/4 hour; and the
extent of this was accurately determined by means of a
photometer. He found an augmentation of seven tenths of a
magnitude in the brightness of the comet, and an equally
sudden fall to its previous lustre. While these fluctuations
were in progress, he noticed variations in the shape of the
nucleus not less remarkable than its variations in light.
Those who observe future comets will do well, therefore, to be
on the alert for similar phenomena. The apparent brightness
of the nuclei and alterations of shape or size should be
recorded on every night when observations are feasible.</p>

<p>As a comet approaches the Sun its material apparently
contracts, while with increasing distance from that luminary
it expands. Usually the nucleus is extremely small and
bright, and it often looks like a star shining through nebulosity.
High powers must therefore be applied in its examination.
Jets, aigrettes, luminous sectors, and other appendages
are often involved with the nucleus and outlying coma,
and they form a complicated structure well deserving further
study. A good deal of mystery still surrounds these appearances;
their curious forms and vagaries have yet to be
explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>Stars are frequently observed through the head of a comet,
which apparently, however, exercises no influence in dimming
their lustre. But the stars are commonly seen behind the
envelopes or comæ, and very rarely through the nucleus.
Nothing is better calculated to exhibit the transparent and
tenuous character of comets than observations of this kind,
and observers should seek for further opportunities of making
them. If the motion of a comet is obviously carrying it in
the direction of one of the stars in the field, the observer may
determine for himself the approximate time of conjunction
by noting the distance between the star and comet and allowing
for the motion of the latter. He will then know when to
come to his telescope and witness the phenomenon. Should
it appear probable that the comet’s nucleus will pass over the
star, he should commence his watch some time before it
occurs; he may then make comparisons before the star is involved
in the outlying nebulosity, and trace the whole event
from beginning to end. Any changes in the light or aspect
of either star or comet would then be manifested. The comet
of 1847 is said to have passed centrally over a 5th mag. star,
but the latter was unaffected. Encke’s Comet on one occasion
interposed itself directly over one of a pair of 10th mag.
stars, but their relatively equal brilliancy suffered no change.
Encke’s Comet, however, has no stellar nucleus. The latter
feature is so bright and compact as displayed in many other
comets, that its transit over a small star must have some effect
either in obliterating it altogether, or in detracting from its
lustre.</p>

<p>Visible evidences of rotation seem to have been suspected
in certain comets, but this has never been substantiated on
sufficient grounds. The circumstance is one, however, which
should be remembered. During a series of observations the
observer who notes the details of structure with particular
regard to position may discover similar traces, and possibly
learn something of the cause. The nucleus of a bright comet
should always be examined with a moderately high power, so
that any variations or peculiarities of form may be detected.</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature of Comets.</i>—It must be confessed that no
perfectly satisfactory method has yet been devised as regards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
the naming of comets. The plan of affixing Roman numbers
progressively for each year, according to date of perihelion
passage, answers pretty well, though a little confusion is
sometimes caused by prematurely affixing the number, especially
when two comets are discovered successively, the first
of which is a long time before perihelion, and the second
considerably after it. Until a comet can be safely assigned
its catalogue place, it is preferable to refer to it by the name
of the discoverer and date of discovery. This is more distinctive
than the common method of lettering comets according
to the epochs of their detection. As to periodical comets, it
is not difficult to find some inconsistencies in their names.
In the case of Halley’s Comet (1682, discovered by Flamsteed)
and Encke’s Comet (1819 I., discovered by Pons), it
was most fitting that they should be known to posterity by
the names of the two able computers whose investigations
first revealed to us comets of long and short period respectively.
Under ordinary circumstances the name of the discoverer
is applied to a comet as a means of convenient reference,
and perhaps as a suitable recognition of the patient labours of
the man who first announced it to the world. The plan seems
to have been to name comets after those fortunate persons who
sighted them at the particular apparition during which periodicity
was determined. Thus Tuttle’s Comet (1858 I.) had been
seen as long before as 1790 by Mechain, and Biela’s (1826 I.)
was previously observed in 1772 by Montaigne, and in 1805
by Pons. It is, however, strange that a comet found by
Pons in 1819 (III. of that year), and which Encke showed to
be revolving in an ellipse with a periodic time of 5½ years,
should be called after Winnecke, who rediscovered it in 1858.
To Pons the real priority belongs, though Winnecke deserves
much praise for redetecting and identifying this body after it
had effected six unobserved returns to perihelion. It is also
curious to find that the comet of short period discovered by
Swift in 1880 is called “Tempel’s 3rd Comet” in Galle’s
catalogue (1885), from the fact that Tempel found it at a
previous return (1869), when, however, its period was not
ascertained. There is little doubt that the title justly belongs
to Swift. Tempel himself called it “Swift’s Comet.” One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
plan should in fairness to observers be consistently adhered to.
If comets are to be called after their original discoverers, then
Biela’s Comet should be known as “Montaigne’s,” Tuttle’s as
“Mechain’s,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Curiosities of Comets.</i>—The comet of 1729, which was
hardly visible to the naked eye, has far the greatest perihelion
distance (4·0435) of any comet known. Barnard’s Comet
(1885 II.) comes next with a perihelion distance of 2·5068.</p>

<p>Pons’s Comet at its return in 1883-4 remained visible for
nine months. When last seen, on June 2, 1884, it was 470
millions of miles from the Earth, and more remote in the
depths of space than any other observed comet since that of
1729. Barnard’s Comet (1889 I.), though never visible to the
naked eye, was followed from Sept. 2, 1888, to Aug. 18,
1890. Its distance from the Sun was then 6·25 (Earth’s
distance = 1), or about 580 millions of miles, which is greater
than that of many of the short-period comets at aphelia.
The most prolonged visibility of any previous comet was
that of 1811 I. (510 days). But this comet of Barnard has
been retained in view 715 days.</p>

<p>The great comet of 1882 was watched right up to the Sun’s
limb by Messrs. Finlay and Elkin at the Cape of Good Hope
on Sept. 16, 1882. The comet was actually seen to disappear
at the margin, and not a vestige of it could be traced
during its transit across the solar disk. The nucleus of the
comet was 4” in diameter, and before transit it looked as
bright as a part of the Sun’s surface; but it was quite invisible
when projected on the disk. The alleged observations by
Pastorff and Stark, which were construed into visible transits
of comets, are therefore thoroughly disproved, and will require
another interpretation.</p>

<p>At the time of the total solar eclipse of May 17, 1882, a
bright comet was observed near the Sun. It was a striking
object visible to the naked eye. In the photographs which
were taken of the eclipse the comet is well shown, but this
body escaped subsequent observation, so that its orbit could
not be determined.</p>

<p><i>Naked-eye Comets.</i>—Arago mentions that twelve comets
were visible to the naked eye during the period from 1800 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
1853, but there appear to have been certainly thirty comets
fulfilling this condition, and I believe a careful search amongst
cometary records would further augment the number. During
the ten years from 1880 to 1889 inclusive there were no less
than sixteen comets perceptible to unaided vision, and a considerable
proportion of these were fine comets. It is very
rarely that two naked-eye comets are to be seen at the same
epoch, as in August 1881 and at the end of April 1886.</p>

<p><i>Comet-seeking.</i>—For a long time after the invention of the
telescope comet-seeking does not appear to have been undertaken
in a methodical way, and to have formed the habitual
work of certain observers. But the expected return of
Halley’s Comet in 1759 roused observers to take the initiative
in a branch of practical research which in after years was
destined to prove remarkably productive. Messier, Palitzch,
and others began a system of sweeping the heavens for the
predicted comet; and it had a successful issue, for Palitzch,
who did not relax his labours even on Christmas day, alighted
upon the coveted prize on Dec. 25, 1758. Since that time a
regular search after comets has been maintained. Messier
pursued it with indomitable energy through a long period of
years, and achieved many successes. It is said of him that on
one occasion he was anticipated in a discovery by Montaigne,
and he appears to have deplored the loss of the comet more
than the loss of his wife, who was lying dead at the time. A
friend visited him, and spoke a few words of sympathy in
reference to his bereavement, but Messier, in despair about
the comet, exclaimed: “I had discovered twelve—alas! that
I should be robbed of the thirteenth by Montaigne!” and his
eyes filled with tears. Recollecting himself, and appreciating
the loss he had sustained in his wife, he added, “Ah, this poor
woman!” Messier encountered some serious obstacles to his
favourite pursuit. Breen, in his ‘Planetary Worlds,’ mentions
that Messier, while walking in President Saron’s garden,
fell into an ice-house, and was disabled for a time.
Later on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> “the revolution deprived him of his little income
and every evening he was wont to repair to the house of
Lalande to replenish the supply of oil for his midnight lamp.
The political storm necessitated his removal to another neighbourhood,
where he no longer heard the clocks of forty-two
churches sounding the hours during his night-watchings.”
Messier discovered all his comets with a small 2-foot telescope
of 2½ inches aperture magnifying 5 times and with a field of 4°.</p>

<p>Dr. Olbers, of Bremen, was another diligent student in this
field. He did not effect many discoveries, but, from an upper
apartment of his house, he observed nearly all the comets
which appeared during half a century.</p>

<p>During the first twenty-seven years of the present century,
Pons discovered the majority of the comets that were seen.
He was a door-keeper at the Observatory at Marseilles, and
owing to the teaching and encouragement he received from
Thulis, the director, he achieved phenomenal success as a
comet-hunter.</p>

<p>Discoveries of comets have rarely been effected in England.
This is chiefly to be assigned to two circumstances. First,
because the labour involved in seeking for these bodies has
never perhaps been pursued to an equal degree and with the
same tenacity as it formerly was in France, and as it has
recently been in the United States; and second, because the
cloud-laden skies of England oppose the successful prosecution
of a research in which a clear atmosphere is eminently
desirable.</p>

<p>Though comet-seeking does not always produce new discoveries,
it is certainly entertaining to those engaged in it; for
one of the most agreeable diversions of telescopic work is to
scan the firmament with a large-field comet-eyepiece, which
exhibits the most pleasing views of star-groups, coloured stars,
nebulæ, and telescopic meteors.</p>

<p>The operation of sweeping for comets is attractive from
other aspects, though it undoubtedly needs close application,
patience, and much caution. The possibility of seeing a
comet in the field at any time proves a constant source of
allurement to the observer, and sustains his enthusiasm. The
glimpsing of a nebulous object, and the expectation (before it
has been identified) that it <em>may</em> prove a comet, induces a little
excitement which pleasantly relieves the monotony that might
otherwise be attached to a sedulous research of this nature; and
it is one in which amateurs may suitably engage with a fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
prospect of success. Instruments of great power, refinement,
and expense are not required. It is rather a work calling for
the exercise of patience and acute perception, and for that
tireless servitude which those only who have an inborn love
for it can maintain.</p>

<p><i>English Weather and Comet-seeking.</i>—Only two new comets
having been discovered in England during the last forty years
some people regard our climate as in a great measure responsible
for this. But the opinion seems to be erroneous. The
lack of discoveries has arisen from want of effort as much as
from want of opportunity. The best weather for comet-seeking
is when the atmosphere is very transparent, and the stars
are lucid and sparkling. Haze, fog, or cloud of any kind
offers a serious hindrance. A thoroughly good night for
planetary work is not usually good for cometary observation,
because sharp definition is not so requisite as a very clear sky.
A little fog or thin cloud, which will often improve planetary
images, utterly obliterates a small telescopic comet. The air
is sometimes very pure and dark after storms, and the stars
remarkably bright; it is then that the best opportunities are
afforded for comet-hunting. Any systematic and regular
work like this may be pursued in this country with every
prospect of success by an observer who will persevere in it.
From some statistics printed in the ‘Science Observer,’
Boston, it appears that during the seven months from May to
November, 1882, Lewis Swift was comet-seeking during 300
hours. I have no English results of the same kind, but my
meteoric observations will supply a means of comparison.
From June to November, 1887 (six months), I was observing
during 217 hours, and for a nearly similar period during the
last half of 1877, though in each year work was only attempted
with the Moon absent. My result for 1887 averages 36 hours
per month, which is little less than the average derived from
the comet-seeking records above quoted. It is therefore
fair to suppose that as much may be done here as in some
regions of the United States. Mr. W. R. Brooks wrote
me in 1889, saying: “We have much cloudy weather in
this part of America. While in other portions of the country
clear weather abounds, it is not so in this section, where much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
of my work has been done. This is a most fertile section—the
beautiful lake region of N.Y.,—but it is for this reason a
cloudy belt. It is far different in Colorado and California.
In the latter place, at the Lick Observatory, I hear they have
300 clear nights in the year—a paradise for the astronomical
observer! My former site, the Red House Observatory, Phelps,
N.Y., is only six miles from Geneva, and hence in the same
cloudy region.” Prof. Swift also referred to the subject of
weather in a letter to me dated July 30, 1889, where he says:
“I arrived home, after a five weeks’ visit to the Lick Observatory,
on March 1, and have not had half a dozen first-class
nights since—not in thirty years have I seen such prolonged
rainy and cloudy weather.” Now Mr. Brooks has discovered
13 comets in 7 years, Prof. Swift has found 8 comets (1862-1890),
and in addition to these has detected more than 700
new nebulæ, all of the latter since 1883. From this it appears
conclusively that if such extensive and valuable results
can be obtained, notwithstanding frequently bad weather, then
English observers may prove equally successful, the important
factor being that similar energy and ability direct their
labours.</p>

<p><i>Aperture and Power required.</i>—Opinions are divided as to
the most suitable aperture and power for this work. Any
telescope of from 4-to 10-inches aperture may be employed
in it. A low power (30 to 50) and large field (50′ to 90´)
eyepiece are imperative; and the instrument, to be really
effective, should be mounted to facilitate sweeping either in
a vertical or horizontal direction. A reflector on an alt-azimuth
stand is a most convenient form for vertical sweeps.
The defining-capacity of the telescope need not necessarily be
perfect to be thoroughly serviceable, the purpose being to
distinguish faint nebulous bodies, and not details of form. Far
more will depend upon the observer’s aptitude and persistency
than upon his instrumental means, which ought to be regarded
as a mere adjunct to his powers and not a controlling influence
in success, for the latter lies in himself. Very large instruments
are not often used, because of their necessarily restricted
fields. Moreover, a small instrument, apart from its advantage
in this respect, is worked with greater facility and expedition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
This is important, especially when the observer is to examine
the region in the immediate neighbourhood of the Sun. He
has then a very brief interval for the attainment of his purpose,
and a small telescope must be used on account of its large
field, its ready manipulation, and its general effectiveness on
objects at low altitudes. The case is somewhat different when
the search is to be conducted in regions far removed from the
Sun’s place; for here the comets are in general faint, and there
is time for the work to be deliberately and critically performed.
Large instruments are to be recommended for these
districts as capable of revealing fainter objects, though they
are troublesome in several respects. They show large numbers
of nebulæ, especially if the observer is exploring the region of
Virgo, Coma Berenices, or Ursa Major; and he will have
great difficulty in identifying them and in feeling his way
with certainty. These complications are inseparable from the
work, and, though chiefly affecting large apertures, should
not always be shunned; for a telescope capable of displaying
very faint nebulæ is also capable of showing faint comets.
Many comets have eluded discovery by the inadequate reach
of the instruments in the hands of comet-seekers; and the
statement recently made that there are only about one hundred
nebulæ liable to be mistaken for comets is not accurate, because
comets in certain positions are of the last degree of faintness,
and there is no identifying them from small nebulæ except by
means of their motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Brooks says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>—“Medium magnifying powers, with
necessarily moderate-sized fields, are better than very low
powers and large fields. While with the latter a large amount
of the sky can be swept over in a given time, the work is not
so well done, and a faint comet would be easily swept over and
not seen. A small region, <em>thoroughly worked</em>, is far more likely
to be successful. This gives a feeling of satisfaction with the
work performed, even with negative results. In support of
this I may remark that, during all the years I have engaged
in comet-seeking, not a single comet has been discovered by
another astronomer in a region of the heavens that I had just
previously searched; so that I have never had occasion to feel
that I had swept over a comet and missed seeing it. Aside
from the obvious requirement of good eyesight, capable of
detecting exceedingly faint objects, a good telescope of at least
moderate aperture, and a familiarity attained by experience
with the large number of nebulæ resembling telescopic comets,
the comet-seeker, to be successful, must possess in a high
degree the qualities of patience, perseverance, energy, and
enthusiasm. I have the highest admiration for the man
or woman who discovers a comet, because I know of the
hard and thorough work which the success implies.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brooks’s experience and success in this branch give
weight to his suggestions, and there can be little doubt that
his commendation of moderate powers is fully justified. I
believe he usually sweeps with a power of 40 (field of 1° 20′)
on the 10-1/8-inch equatoreal of his observatory. Speaking for
myself, I find powers of 32 (field 1-1/4°) and 40 (field 1°)
perform very satisfactorily on my 10-inch With-Browning
reflector, having frequently tried them on faint nebulæ and
comets. Sometimes I employ a power of 60, field 50′; but
for ordinary purposes this is too high. It is a good plan
to sweep with a moderate power, say of 40, and to keep
a higher magnifier at hand to examine any suspicious objects
that may be picked up. With power 32 I often encounter
forms, the real character of which is uncertain. In such
cases I clamp the telescope and apply the power 60, which
generally exhibits the objects as several minute stars grouped
together, or possibly nebulæ, in which case I proceed to
identify them. With lower magnifiers than 30 there must
always be considerable danger of sweeping over faint comets.
Some of these are only of the 10th, 11th, or 12th mag., and
less than 1′ diameter, and must certainly elude detection
unless adequate power is brought to bear upon them. Dr.
Doberck mentioned in the L. A. S. Journal, vol. vi. p. 236,
an instrument for comet-seeking, 3½ inches in aperture,
power about 10, and field of 5°, which was bought in 1842
by the late Mr. Cooper at Markree. But though with such
a telescope a very large portion of the firmament might be
swept in one night, there would be serious disadvantages; for
small faint comets would pass through the field unseen, and
render the work abortive. The necessary conditions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
case go far to support the view that moderate powers and
fields are best; for a search, to be thorough and satisfactory,
must be done critically, and with a power capable of revealing
the smallest specimens of comets.</p>

<p><i>Annual Rate of Discovery.</i>—Arranging cometary discoveries
during the century from 1782 to 1881 into periods of
20 years, and comparing the annual average with that during
the last eight years, we get the following numbers:—</p>

<p>Of 289 comets discovered during the last 108 years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
123 belonged to the first six months, while no less than
166 belonged to the last half of the year.</p>

<p>Though comets are not confined to any special region
of the heavens, there is no doubt that the vicinity of the Sun
is the spot to which the comet-seeker should direct his chief
attention. It is here where the majority of the discoveries
have been made; and theoretically this should be so, seeing
that the Sun is the controlling influence of the cometary
flights, and that his position must be regarded as a sort of
focus of their convergence and divergence. Hence the most
likely spots are over the western horizon after sunset and the
eastern horizon before sunrise. The twilight and zodiacal
light, together with the mist at low altitudes, are impediments
which are inseparable from this work; but they need not
interfere to any serious extent if the observer is careful to
make the best of his opportunities. But though special
attention is recommended to the neighbourhood of the Sun,
other regions should not be altogether neglected, for comets
are occasionally found in nearly the opposite part of the
heavens to the Sun’s place, as, for example, Zona’s Comet of
November 1890. In order to save time, and to prevent
troublesome references during the progress of sweeping, the
brighter nebulæ should be marked upon a star-chart, so that,
as they enter the field, they may be instantly identified.</p>

<p><i>Telescopic Comets</i> vary in size to a considerable degree.
In diameter they generally range from about 1′ to 7′, and are
usually round, with a bright centre like the globular clusters
Messier 2, 3, 13, 15, 49, and 92, as seen with a low power;
but occasionally they are faint diffused masses, like the planetary
nebula near β Ursæ Majoris, M. 97, or the large nebula
S. of ξ Cassiopeiæ, in the New General Catalogue, No. 185,
R.A. 0<sup>h</sup> 33<sup>m</sup>, Dec. 47° 44′ N. In brightness they range from
being visible to the naked eye to objects of the last degree of
faintness. They average some 2′ or 3′ diameter, but are
sometimes less than 1′; so that the power of the sweeper
should be capable of readily showing an object of this size as
it passes through the field. The observer should turn his
instrument upon the small planetary nebula N.G.C. 1501,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>R.A. 3<sup>h</sup> 57<sup>m</sup>, Dec. 60° 37′ N. in Camelopardus. It is
about 1′ diameter. He should also pick up N.G.C. 6654,
R.A. 18<sup>h</sup> 27<sup>m</sup>, Dec. 73° 6′ N., which is a star of about
12½ mag. involved in a pretty conspicuous nebulosity. Swift
describes the latter as looking just like a comet. N.G.C. 6217,
R.A. 16<sup>h</sup> 38<sup>m</sup>, Dec. 78° 25′ N., is also a small nebulosity
which might easily be overlooked with a low power. Let
the observer examine the three objects named, and he will
gather a good idea of a small telescopic comet, especially
from N.G.C. 6654, which may be readily found, as it is in
the same field as χ Draconis, and visible at any time
of the year and night. N.G.C. 6643, R.A. 18<sup>h</sup> 23<sup>m</sup>,
Dec. 74° 32′ N., is near the latter, but it is a brighter
object. The observer will find two tolerably plain nebulæ
in the same field at about R.A. 6<sup>h</sup> 52<sup>m</sup>, Dec. 85° 56′; so that
they are only 4° from the pole. They are N.G.C. 2276
and 2300. These objects ought not to elude detection in any
instrument properly adapted for comet-seeking.</p>

<p><i>Ascertaining Positions.</i>—No observer should be without the
means of determining exact positions. A ring-micrometer and
comprehensive star-catalogues are most important accessories
of the amateur. When a suspicious object is found its precise
position should be instantly measured; but if no micrometer
is at hand, the observer should carefully note the place relatively
to adjoining stars, and then, after a short interval,
re-observe it for traces of motion. In these comparisons the
low-power eyepiece should be exchanged for one of greater
amplification, because this will render a slight motion more
readily sensible. If the suspicious object proves to be a
comet, the extent and direction of its daily motion should be
computed from the change in the observed places, and the
information telegraphed to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
A statement should also be given as to the diameter and
brightness of the object; we may then be satisfied that it will
be readily picked up at some of the many stations where
prompt attention is given to this class of observation. Amateurs
who do not attempt to obtain exact positions are sometimes
condemned for their negligence in this respect, and
most unjustly so. By far the hardest part of the work falls
to them, and professional astronomers ought to be indebted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
to amateurs for leaving to their care an important feature of
these observations. If the latter are to undertake the labour
of measuring as well as discovering comets, then there will be
nothing left in this line for the elaborate instruments of
observatories to do. Yet, while thus objecting to amateurs,
with their generally incomplete and inefficient appliances,
being expected to perform the work both of discovery and
exact observation, it cannot be denied that there is a great
necessity for them to have the means of measurement, and to
utilize them during the first few observations, which are
usually made before the comet has been seen elsewhere, and
will therefore possess great value if precise.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Doberck’s Hints.</i>—Dr. Doberck has given some useful
hints in connection with this subject:—“In order to be as
sure as possible of ultimate success it is not enough to sweep
with the instrument and watch any suspicious object for
proper motion. It is better to procure a large map such as
Argelander’s, and, comparing the image seen in the comet-seeker
with the map, to insert all the nebulous objects according
as they are discovered. At the end of the watch they are
then compared with the catalogues of nebulæ and clusters
of stars. A general catalogue facilitates this, but is never
quite sufficient, as there seems to be no limit to the number of
objects in the sky, and more are constantly being catalogued.
In the course of time an observer learns to remember the
objects he has seen before in the seeker, and at last he need
not consult the map at all. The subsequent observation of
a newly-found comet is best made with the ring-micrometer
if the telescope is not equatoreally mounted. In the latter
case it should be made by aid of a steel-bar micrometer.
As soon as three observations are available the first approximation
to a parabolic orbit can generally be determined:
the calculation of which is quite elementary, and would be
enjoyed by many amateur astronomers who are fond of
figures and would easily get used to Olbers’s method. Only
the three positions must not be so near each other as to lie on
a great circle.”</p>

<p><i>Prizes for Discoveries.</i>—The Vienna Academy of Sciences
formerly gave a gold medal to the discoverer of every new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
comet. These presentations were discontinued in about
1880; and Mr. H. H. Warner then offered a prize of $200
for every unexpected comet found in the United States or in
Canada. This prize was continued in subsequent years, and
the conditions were amended so as to include observers in
Europe. Many of these prizes were gained by Barnard
and Brooks; but they have not been re-offered during the
past year or two. Mr. Warner, however, contemplates
renewing them. The Astronomical Society of the Pacific
now awards a bronze medal to all such discoverers.</p>

<p>No one can contemplate the firmament for long on a clear
  moonless night without noticing one or more of those luminous
  objects called shooting-stars. They are particularly numerous
  in the autumnal months, and will sometimes attract special
  attention either by their frequency of apparition or by their
  excessive brilliancy in individual cases. For many ages little
  was known of these bodies, though some of the ancient philosophers
  appear to have formed correct ideas as to their astronomical
  nature. Humboldt says that Diogenes of Apollonia,
  who probably belonged to the period intermediate between
  Anaxagoras and Democritus, expressed the opinion that,
  “together with the visible stars, there are invisible ones
  which are therefore without names. These sometimes fall
  upon the Earth and are extinguished, as took place with the
  star of stone which fell at Ægos Potamoi.” Plutarch, in
  the ‘Life of Lysander,’ remarks:—“Falling stars are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
  emanations or rejected portions thrown off from the ethereal
  fire, which when they come into our atmosphere are extinguished
  after being kindled: they are, rather, celestial bodies
  which, having once had an impetus of revolution, fall, or are
  cast down to the Earth, and are precipitated, not only on
  inhabited countries, but also, and in greater numbers, beyond
  these into the great sea, so that they remain concealed.”</p>

<p>In later times, however, opinions became less rational.
  Falling stars were considered to be of a purely terrestrial
  nature, and originated by exhalations in the upper regions
  of the air. Shakespeare expressed the popular belief when
  he wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent20">“I shall fall</div>
  <div class="verse">Like a bright exhalation in the evening,</div>
  <div class="verse">And no man see me more.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another theory, attributed to Laplace, Arago, and others,
was that meteors were ejections from lunar volcanoes. But
these explanations were not altogether satisfactory in their
application. The truth is, that men had commenced to
theorize before they had begun to observe and accumulate
facts. They had learnt little or nothing as to the numbers,
directions, and appearances of meteors, and therefore possessed
no materials on which to found any plausible hypothesis
to account for them.</p>

<p><i>Meteoric Apparitions.</i>—The occasional apparition of brilliant
detonating fireballs, the occurrence of remarkable star-showers,
the precipitation upon the Earth’s surface of stony masses, were
facts which could be verified from many independent sources,
and they set men thinking how to account for the strange and
startling freaks of nature as exhibited in such phenomena.
But though records existed of exceptionally large meteors and
of meteor-showers, the descriptions were imperfect and failed
in the most important details. The observers were usually
unprepared for witnessing such events, and gave exaggerated
and inaccurate accounts of what they had seen. The vivid
brightness of a fireball (overpowering the lustre of the stars,
and even vieing with the Moon in splendour), the flaming train
left in its wake (curling itself up into grotesque shapes, as it
drifted and died away), the form of the nucleus with its jets and
sparks, and the final explosion, with the reverberations it caused,
were all alluded to by the enthusiastic observer; but it was
only in rare cases that the more valuable features were placed
on record. The <em>direction</em> and <em>duration</em> of the meteor’s flight
amongst the stars were facts of greater significance than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
mere visible aspect of the object; but they were seldom
regarded. Hence the early observations proved of little
weight in inducing just conceptions as to the phenomena
of meteors.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no celestial event which can compare, as
regards its striking aspect and interesting features, with that
of a meteoric display of the most brilliant kind. A large
comet, a total solar eclipse, a bright display of aurora, have
each their attractive and imposing forms; but the effect produced
is hardly equal to that during the Earth’s <i lang="fr">rencontre</i>
with a dense meteor-swarm. The firmament becomes alive
with shooting-stars of every magnitude; their incessant
flights are directed to every point of the compass for several
hours; and the scene is so animated, and one of such peculiarly
impressive and novel character, that it can never be
forgotten by those who have been among its fortunate
spectators.</p>

<p><i>Radiation of Meteors.</i>—Heis, in Germany, was the pioneer in
this branch of practical astronomy. About half a century ago
he began systematic observations, and gathered many useful
data. Schmidt, at Bonn and Athens, followed his example;
and in England Prof. Alexander Herschel and Mr. R. P. Greg
devoted themselves to the subject with highly successful results.
Their collective labours revealed a large number of well-defined
systems of meteors, and enabled them to publish tables of the
radiant-points. The investigations were more precise than
formerly, and conducted on methods ensuring more accurate
and plentiful materials. The radiation of meteors from fixed
points in the sky had been observed before in regard to the
great display which occurred in November 1833; but the
meteors that fell on ordinary nights were regarded as sporadic,
until Heis and his immediate successors showed they were
reducible to an orderly arrangement and that every one of
them had its radiant-point and its origin in a definite meteor-stream.
The apparently divergent flights from a common
centre are simply due to the effects of perspective on bodies
really moving in parallel directions and collected into groups
more or less scattered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

</div>

<p><i>Identity of Meteors and Comets.</i>—The mystery concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
these fugitive objects and their vagaries of appearance was not
always to remain concealed. Denison Olmsted had, in his work
on ‘The Mechanism of the Heavens,’ published in 1850, stated
that the constitution of the body to which the meteors of 1833
belonged bore “a strong analogy to comets.” Reichenbach,
in 1858, wrote a paper in which it was sought to prove that a
comet is a swarm of meteorites. Prof. Kirkwood, in 1861,
also concluded that “meteors and meteoric rings are the
debris of ancient but now disintegrated comets, whose matter
has become distributed around their orbits.” But it remained
for Schiaparelli, of Milan, in 1866, to demonstrate the identity
of meteoric and cometary systems. Others had reasoned up to
it, and observers had amassed many useful observations bearing
on the subject; but absolute proof was wanting until Schiaparelli
supplied it. He computed elements for a well-known
shower of meteors occurring on August 10th, and found the
orbit presented a very close resemblance to that of Comet III.
1862; and he detected a similar analogy between the November
meteors and Comet I. 1866. The orbit of the April meteors
was afterwards shown by Galle and Weiss to agree with the
path of Comet I. 1861; and a meteor-shower occurring at
the end of November was found to coincide with Biela’s
Comet. Facts like these could not be disproved. Comets
were thenceforth known to be the parents—the derivative
source—of meteors. Thus two important classes of objects
became as one, the differences observed being merely those of
aspect due to the variable conditions under which they were
presented. The great meteor-shower of November was found
to be the dispersed materials of Tempel’s Comet of 1866 seen
in detail and from a near standpoint. Every meteoric display
was known to be the visible effects of the collision of the Earth
with a comet or with the great stream of planetary fragments
describing a cometary orbit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p><i>Aerolites.</i>—Meteors enter our atmosphere with such great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
velocity that the friction induced by their impact is sufficient
to destroy them by combustion. They rarely approach the
Earth’s surface within 15 miles. Occasionally, however, a
slow-moving meteor of large size, and formed of a very
compact substance, will penetrate entirely through the air-strata
and fall upon the Earth’s surface. Many instances of
the kind have been recorded, and a few of these are quoted
below:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1478 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The Parian chronicle records that an aerolite or
thunder-stone fell in the island of Crete. This
appears to be the earliest stone-fall described in
history.</p>

<p class="hang">654 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> A shower of stones descended near Rome.</p>

<p class="hang">465 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> A stone, surrounded with fire, fell in Thrace.
This stone is referred to by several ancient writers.
It was termed the “Mother of the Gods” and is
said to have fallen at the feet of the poet Pindar.</p>

<p class="hang">52 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> A shower of iron descended at Lucania, in the
time of Crassus.</p>

<p class="hang">1492 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> A stone weighing 262 lb. fell at Ensisheim, in
Alsace.</p>

<p class="hang">1642. A stone of 4 lb. fell near Woodbridge, in Suffolk.</p>

<p class="hang">1795, Dec. 13. A stone of 56 lb. fell at Wold Cottage,
Thwing, Yorkshire.</p>

<p class="hang">1860, July 14. A shower of aerolites fell at Dhurmsala,
in India. A tremendous detonation attended their
descent, and the natives became greatly alarmed.
They supposed the stones to have been thrown by
some of their deities from the summit of the Himalayas,
and many of them were preserved as objects
of religious veneration.</p>

<p class="hang">1864, May 14. A very large meteor was observed in France.
At Montauban and the neighbourhood deafening
explosions occurred, and showers of stones fell near
the villages of Orgueil and Nohic.</p>

<p class="hang">1876, April 20. A piece of iron weighing 7-3/4 lb. fell at
Rowton, Shropshire.</p>

<p class="hang">1881, March 14. A stone weighing 3 lb. 8-1/4 oz. fell at
Middlesborough, Yorkshire, on a part of the North-Eastern
Railway Company’s branch line. The
descent of the aerolite was witnessed by an inspector
and three platelayers, who were working about fifty
yards distant. At first they became aware of a
whizzing or rushing noise in the air, immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
followed by the sudden blow of a body striking the
ground near. The hole, 11 inches deep, which the
stone made was found directly after, and the stone
was extracted.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many other examples might be given, but the above will
be sufficient for our purpose. Records of this nature were
discredited in former times; but more modern researches
have long since placed their reality beyond all question.
The fall of stones from the sky is no longer regarded as
a mere legendary tale, but as one of the well-assured
operations of nature.</p>

<p>Meteoric stones and irons have been classified according to
the ingredients of their composition. Those in which iron is
found in considerable amount are termed siderites, those containing
an admixture of iron and stone, siderolites, and those
consisting almost entirely of stone are known as aerolites.
The siderite which fell in Shropshire on April 20, 1876, forms
only the seventh recorded instance where a mass of meteoric
iron has been actually seen to fall.</p>

<p><i>Fireballs.</i>—The table on p. 268 gives the dates, heights, &amp;c.
of fifteen fireballs observed during the last quarter of a
century.</p>

<p>Fireballs are sometimes detonating, though more often
silent. The fireball of Nov. 23, 1877, gave a sound like
salvoes of artillery, and doors and windows were shaken
violently. At Chester the noise of its explosion was compared
to loud but distant thunder. Lieut.-Col. Tupman says that
“thunder, to be loud, must be within five miles; hence it
appears that the violence of the explosion must have been at
least a hundred times greater than a peal of thunder, the
intensity of sound-waves diminishing as the square of the
distance.” “The explosion of a 13-inch bomb-shell, consisting
of some 200 lb. of iron, would not have produced a sound of
one hundredth part of the intensity of the meteor-explosion.”
This fireball must therefore have been an object of considerable
mass before its dissolution; and it is fortunate that such bodies
are usually destroyed by the effects of combustion before they
reach the Earth’s surface.</p>

<p>These phenomena exhibit many varieties of appearance.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is no visible explosion; the bright nucleus
slowly dies out until reduced to a faint spark before final
disappearance. Several outbursts of light are often noted;
and a curious halting motion has been observed in regard to
large slow-moving meteors. I have occasionally remarked a
succession of four brilliant flashes given by individual fireballs.
These flashes, though sometimes of startling intensity,
are somewhat different to the transient vividness of lightning;
they come more softly, and remind one forcibly of moonlight
breaking suddenly from the clear intervals in passing clouds.</p>

<p>Fireballs differ vastly from shooting-stars in point of size;
but their origin is identical. The August meteor-shower
yields the smallest shooting-stars and the largest type of fireballs.
The great display of meteors on Nov. 27, 1885, not
only presented us with large and small members, but it also
furnished us with a siderite or piece of iron, presumably from
Biela’s Comet. This fell at Mazapil, Mexico; and as considerable
interest is attached to the case, I quote a part of the
discoverer’s statement:—</p>

<p>“It was at about 9 o’clock on the night of November 27th,
when I went out to the corral to feed certain horses: suddenly
I heard a loud sizzing noise, exactly as though something red-hot
was being plunged into cold water; and almost instantly
there followed a somewhat loud thud. At once the corral was
covered with a phosphorescent light; while suspended in the
air were small luminous sparks, as though from a rocket....
A number of people came running towards me; and when we
had recovered from our fright we saw the light disappear, and
bringing lanterns to look for the cause found a hole in the
ground, and in it a ball of light. We retired to a distance,
fearing it would explode and harm us. Looking up to the
sky, we saw from time to time exhalations of stars, which soon
went out without noise. We returned after a little, and found
in the hole a hot stone which we could barely handle; this,
on the next day, we saw looked like a piece of iron. All
night it rained stars; but we saw none fall to the ground, as
they all seemed to be extinguished while yet very high up.”</p>

<p>This is the first observed instance in which a meteorite has
actually reached the Earth’s surface during the progress of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
star-shower. If its identity with the meteors of Biela’s Comet
is admitted, then all classes of meteoric phenomena would
appear to have a community of origin.</p>

<p><i>Differences of Motion.</i>—Great differences are observed in
the velocity of meteors. An observer may notice all varieties
on the same night of observation. Some will move very
slowly, others shoot quickly across the sky. These differences
are occasioned by the astronomical conditions affecting
the position of the meteor-orbit relatively to the motion
of the Earth. Thus the meteors of Nov. 13 move with
great velocity (44 miles per second), because they come
directly from that part of the heavens towards which the
Earth is moving; hence the orbital speed of the Earth
(18½ miles per second) and meteors (26 miles per second) is
combined in the observed effects. But in the case of the
meteor-shower of Nov. 27 the motions are extremely slow
(about 10 miles per second), as the Earth and the meteors are
travelling nearly parallel in the same direction, and the latter
have to overtake the Earth.</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature of Meteor-Systems.</i>—It is customary to name
the showers after the constellation from which the meteors
appear to diverge. Thus the meteors of April 20 are called
<i>Lyrids</i>, the radiant being in Lyra; the meteors of August 10
are termed <i>Perseids</i>, the point of emanation being in Perseus.
The two great streams of November are known as the <i>Leonids</i>
(13th) and <i>Andromedes</i> (27th). Several showers are often
visible in the same constellation; and when it is desired
to name these according to the above system, it is necessary
to add the approximate star to distinguish them. Thus, in
August there are showers of μ Perseids, ε Perseids, and
α Perseids, in addition to the well-known Perseids of
August 10.</p>

<p><i>Meteor-Storms.</i>—On Nov. 12, 1799, Humboldt, at Cumana,
in South America, saw “thousands of bolides and falling stars
succeed each other during four hours.” On Nov. 12, 1833,
this shower recurred, and was witnessed with magnificent
effect in America. One observer stated that between 4 and
6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> (Nov. 13) about 1000 meteors per minute might
have been counted! Another display occurred on Nov. 13,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
1866, and on this occasion 8485 meteors were enumerated by
several observers at Greenwich. A different system gave us
a brilliant exhibition on Nov. 27, 1872, when 33,000 meteors
were counted by Denza and his assistants at Moncalieri, in
Italy, between the hours of 5<sup>h</sup> 50<sup>m</sup> and 10<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> A
repetition of this phenomenon occurred on Nov. 27, 1885,
when the same observers counted nearly 40,000 meteors
between 6<sup>h</sup> and 10<sup>h</sup> <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span></p>

<div class="caption">Flight of Telescopic Meteors seen by W. R. Brooks, Nov. 28, 1883.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Telescopic Meteors.</i>—Observers who are engaged in seeking
for comets or studying variable stars employ low powers and
large fields, and during the progress of their work notice a
considerable number of small meteors. At some periods
these bodies are more plentiful than at others, and appear
in such rapid succession that the observer’s attention is distracted
from the special work he is pursuing to watch them
more narrowly and record their numbers. Schmidt saw 146
telescopic meteors during ten years. They ranged between
the 7th and 11th mags. Winnecke in the year 1854 noticed
105 of these objects on thirty-two evenings of observation with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
a 3-inch finder, power 15, and field of 3°. I have also remarked
many of these objects when using the comet-eyepieces of my
10-inch reflector<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>, and find they are apparently more numerous
than the ordinary naked-eye meteors in the proportion
of 22 to 1. It would be supposed from the great rapidity
with which the latter shoot across the firmament that the smaller
telescopic meteors are scarcely distinguishable by their motion,
as they must dart through the field instantaneously and only
be perceptible as lines of light. But this impression is altogether
inconsistent with the appearances observed. They
possess no such velocity, but usually move with extreme
slowness, and not unfrequently the whole of the path is comprised
within the same field of view. The eye is enabled to
follow them as they leisurely traverse their courses, and to
note peculiarities of aspect. Of course, there are considerable
differences of speed observed, but as a rule the rate is decidedly
slow and far less than that shown by naked-eye meteors. I
believe that telescopic meteors are situated at great heights
in the atmosphere, and that their diminutive size and slowness
of movement are due to their remoteness. This conclusion
will hardly be avoided by anyone who attentively studies the
several classes of meteors in their various aspects. Unfortunately
no attempt appears to have been hitherto made to determine
the actual heights of telescopic meteors, owing to the
difficulty of obtaining two reliable observations of the same
object. The only way of securing such data would be for
several observers to watch certain selected regions by prearrangement
either with a low-power telescope or field-glass,
and record the exact times and paths of the meteors seen.
On a comparison of the results a good double observation of
the same object might be found, in which case the real path
could be readily computed.</p>

<p>Future observers should note the different forms of telescopic
meteors. Safarik has divided them into four classes,
viz.:—(1) Well-defined star-like objects of very small size;
(2) Large luminous bodies of some minutes of arc in diameter;
(3) Well-defined disks of a very perceptible diameter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
brighter at the border than at the centre, which gives them
the aspect of hollow transparent shells; and (4) faint diffused
masses of irregular shape, considerable size, and different
colours. He has seen hundreds of meteors of every magnitude
from the 2nd down to the 12th pass through the field
of his 6½-inch reflector (ordinary power 32, field 54′). On
Aug. 30, 1880, 9<sup>h</sup> to 15<sup>h</sup> he observed between 50 and 100
telescopic meteors, and many others were seen on the following
night. Whenever a shower of these bodies, such as that witnessed
by Brooks on Nov. 28, 1883, occurs, observers should
notice whether the objects participate in a common direction
of motion; because, if so, the radiant-point will admit of determination.
The horary rate of their apparition ought also to be
ascertained. Those who habitually search for comets should
invariably make a note of telescopic meteors, as such records
would aid inquiries into the relative frequency of these
phenomena.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Notes.</i></p>

<p><i>Quadrantids.</i> Heis was the first to determine this radiant
accurately. It was subsequently observed by Masters and
Prof. Herschel (1863-4). The radiant is circumpolar in this
latitude, but low down during the greater part of the night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
hence the display is usually seen to the best advantage on the
morning of Jan. 2.</p>

<p><i>Lyrids.</i> Attention was first drawn to the April meteors by
Herrick in the United States. Active displays occurred in
1863 and 1884.</p>

<p>η <i>Aquarids.</i> Further observations are urgently required of
this stream. The radiant is only visible for a short time
before sunrise. There is a considerable difference between my
results and those secured by Lieut.-Col. Tupman, the discoverer
of this system in 1870, whose observations place the radiant
at 326½—2½ April 29-May 3. These May Aquarids are interesting
from the fact that they present an orbital resemblance
to Halley’s Comet, which makes a near approach to the Earth
on May 4, twelve days before reaching the descending node.</p>

<p>δ <i>Aquarids.</i> The meteoric epoch, July 26-30, was first
pointed out by Quetelet many years ago. Biot also found,
from the oldest Chinese observations, a general maximum
between July 18 and 27 (Humboldt). Showers of Aquarids
were remarked by Schmidt, Tupman (1870), and others; but
it was not known until my observations in 1878 that the
Aquarids formed the special display of the epoch, and that
there were many early Perseids visible at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Perseids.</i> Muschenbroeck, in his work on ‘Natural Philosophy,’
printed in 1762, mentions that he observed shooting-stars
to be more numerous in August than in the other months
of the year. Quetelet, in 1835, was, however, the first to
attribute a definite maximum to the 9th-10th. This stream
is remarkable for its extended duration, and for the obvious
displacement which occurs from night to night in the place of
its radiant. It furnishes an annual display of considerable
strength, and is, perhaps, the best known system of all.</p>

<p><i>Orionids.</i> Profs. Schmidt and Herschel were the first to
discover the Orionids as the most brilliant display of the
October period, and accurately determined its radiant in
1863-4-5. Herrick recorded a shower at 99° +26°, Oct. 20-26,
1839, and Zezioli in 1868 recorded many meteors which
were ascribed to a radiant at 111° +29°; but there is no doubt
that the Orionids were observed in both these cases, though
the radiant was badly assigned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>The radiant of the Orionids shows no displacement like
that of the Perseids.</p>

<p><i>Leonids.</i> Observed from the earliest times. Humboldt and
Bonpland saw it well on the night of November 11-12, 1799,
and the phenomenon at its magnificent return on November
12, 1833, was ably discussed by Olmsted. It furnished a
splendid shower in 1866, November 13, and many meteors
were seen at the few subsequent returns. I observed fairly
conspicuous showers of Leonids in 1879 and 1888. There is
no doubt the meteors form a complete ellipse, for the earth
encounters a few of them at every passage through the node.
Grand displays may be expected at the end of this century.</p>

<p><i>Andromedes.</i> Observed by Brandes, at Hamburg, Dec. 7,
1798. It also recurred in 1838; the very brilliant showers
of November 27, 1872 and 1885, are still fresh in the
memory. It is uncertain whether this group forms an unbroken
stream; if so, the regions far removed from the parent
comet must be extremely attenuated. Some of the meteors
were seen in 1877 and 1879. The radiant is diffuse to the
extent of 7° or 10°. Returns of the shower should be looked
for in 1892 and 1898.</p>

<p><i>Geminids.</i> Mr. Greg first called attention to the importance
of this shower. It was well observed by Prof. Herschel in
1861-3-4, and some later years.</p>

<p>There are an enormous number of minor systems, but these
are generally feeble, and interesting only to the regular observer
of meteors. Many showers are so slightly manifested
that they yield but one visible meteor in 6 or 7 hours, and on
the same night of observation there are often as many as 50
or 60 different systems in operation. I gave a list of 918
radiant-points of showers observed at Bristol in the ‘Monthly
Notices,’ May 1890, and other catalogues will be found in
the ‘British Association Reports’ for 1874 and 1878.</p>

<p><i>Varieties of Meteors.</i>—The amateur who systematically
watches for meteors will occasionally remark instances of
anomalous character. I have sometimes observed meteors
which are apparently very near, and move with enormous
velocity. They are mere gleams of pale light, which have
little analogy to ordinary shooting-stars, and suggest an elec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>tric
origin, though I do not know whether the marvellous
quickness with which they flash upon the eye is not to be held
responsible for the impression of nearness. They are somewhat
rare, and one may watch through several entire nights
without a single example, but as far as my memory serves I
must have witnessed some scores of these meteoric flashes.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting class of meteors includes those
which move so slowly that the eye is enabled to note the
details of their appearance. Some of these objects are small
when first seen, but enlarge considerably under the increasing
temperature, and after a great slackening of speed (due to
atmospheric resistance) their nuclei are finally spent in thick
streams of luminous dust. On Dec. 28, 1888, I recorded a
meteor which on its first apparition was tolerably bright,
small, and compact. It moved slowly, and I had an excellent
view of its passage. The nucleus quickly expanded, though
with no increase of brilliancy. Towards the end it assumed
a sensible disk, and at the last phase the mass spread or deployed
itself into a wide stream of fine ashes and disappeared.
The whole phenomenon was so curious, and observed with
such distinctness, that I made the above sketch of it directly
afterwards.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_58"></a>Fig. 58.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(52).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Meteor of Dec. 28, 1888, 6<sup>h</sup> 17<sup>m</sup>.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Heights of Meteors.</i>—Usually the height of meteors at their
first appearance is less than 90 miles, and at disappearance
more than 40 miles. From a comparison of a large number
of computations I derived the following average values:—</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td align="left">Beginning height</td>
  <td align="left">76·4 miles</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">End height</td>
  <td align="left">50·8 miles</td>
  <td align="left">(756 meteors)</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>But if fireballs and the smaller shooting-stars are separated
I find the usual heights at disappearance are:—fireballs, 30
miles; shooting-stars, 54 miles. Fireballs therefore approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
much nearer to the Earth’s surface before disruption than the
ordinary falling stars.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_59"></a>Fig. 59.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(53).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Large Meteor, and successive appearances of its streak, seen at Cape Jask,
in the Persian Gulf, on June 8, 1883, 7<sup>h</sup> 51<sup>m</sup> to 8<sup>h</sup> 33<sup>m</sup>.</div>
</div>

<p>A very slight acquaintance with trigonometry will enable
anyone to compute the real path of a meteor if two or more
observations, made at distant stations, are available for the
purpose. The observed courses of the meteor should be
marked upon a celestial globe, and extended backwards to
the point where they mutually intersect; this will be the
<em>radiant-point</em>. The globe having been set for the time and
latitude, the apparent tracks should also be prolonged in a
forward direction until they meet the horizon, this will indicate
the <em>Earth-points</em>, or azimuths of the place where the
meteor would have been precipitated on the Earth had it been
enabled to continue its flight so far. The azimuths and altitudes
of the beginning and end of the path, and the azimuths
of the Earth-point should then be read off, and by means of
a reliable map and a protractor their points of intersection
over the Earth’s surface may be readily found by lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
drawn from the two places of observation. From the spot
where the Earth-points intersect a straight line should also be
drawn in the direction of the radiant, and it is along this
line the meteor’s motion was directed. The coordinates of
the observed points of appearance and disappearance of the
meteor, at the two stations, would intersect this line at identical
points were the observations perfectly accurate, but this
is rarely the case. The distance between the observer’s station
and the places over which the meteor began and ended is easily
derived from the map, and the height of the object may be
found by adding the logarithm of the distance to the log. of
the tangent of the altitude. Thus, if the end of a meteor is
witnessed from London in azimuth 130° W. of S. (alt. 25°),
and from Bristol in azimuth 216° W. of S. (alt. 30°) the
place of intersection on the map will be at Warwick, so that the
meteor must have disappeared when vertically over this city.
London is distant from Warwick about 86 miles, and from
Bristol 70 miles, and the resulting height of the meteor is:—</p>

</table></div>

<p>so that the observations accord very closely in fixing the
height at a little exceeding 40 miles at disappearance, but a
slight correction is necessary to allow for the Earth’s curvature.
There are other methods of computing the heights,
one of which is explained by Prof. A. S. Herschel in a paper
entitled “Height of a Meteor” (‘Monthly Notices,’ vol. xxv.
p. 251).</p>

<p><i>Meteoric Observations.</i>—A large number of meteor-showers
still await discovery, and there are features even in connection
with the best known streams which remain to be elucidated.
Such doubts as now exist are only to be cleared away by
assiduous observation made with the utmost accuracy possible
both of the <em>directions</em> and <em>durations</em> of meteors.</p>

<p>This attractive field of investigation has certainly been
neglected in recent years, and the reason of this may perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
be found in the complications inseparable from it, in the need
of great patience and scrupulous care in observation, and the
necessity of gaining experience before the observer can feel a
reliance on his work, and draw safe conclusions. Meteors are
so fugitive, so diverse and erratic in their apparitions, as to be
quite beyond the scope of instrumental refinements. They must
necessarily be observed under many disadvantages. Positions
have to be fixed from very hurried and often imperfect impressions.
But these drawbacks, formidable as they at first
appear, may be severally overcome by practice, by careful
regard for the conditions under which meteors are displayed,
and the marked differences of aspect induced by these conditions.
When the observer has acquired a practical knowledge
he will proceed with confidence in his work, and avoid many
of the difficulties surrounding it.</p>

<p>In recording meteor-tracks for the purpose of discovering
the radiant-points, the chief feature in which precision is
essential is the <em>direction</em> of flight. A perfectly straight wand,
held in the hand for the purpose, should be projected upon the
path of every meteor directly it is seen, and then when the
eye has quickly noted the position and slope relatively to the
fixed stars near, it should be reproduced on the chart or celestial
globe. The time, mag., estimated duration, and details of
appearance should be registered in a tabular form, with the
R.A. and Dec. of the beginning-point and probable radiant.
The end-point and length of path may be left until next day,
in order to save valuable time. The wand is a great assistance
to the eye in retaining the approximate directions
and noting the places. If a meteor belongs to the slow,
trained class, or if it belongs to the swift, streak-leaving
order, the path may be very accurately noted, for the wand
can be adjusted to its direction before the meteor or its visible
offcome has died away. In the case of short, quick meteors,
devoid of either streaks or trains, and generally shooting from
radiants at high altitudes, they are more difficult to secure, as
they vanish before one may turn, and the observer must rely
upon the mere impression he received. But even these succumb
to experience, and will be found to resolve themselves
into a number of sharply defined radiants scarcely less certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
than the positions derived from the streaked or trained
meteors.</p>

<p>These positions are only to be fixed by the exercise of much
cautious discrimination on the part of the observer, for the
direction of the flight is not sufficient, alone, to indicate it.
The visible aspect of the meteor has to be equally considered,
for the place of its radiant imparts certain peculiarities to it
which are rarely to be mistaken. First, <em>the astronomical
position</em> of the radiant. If the radiant is at, or within 50° of,
the Earth’s apex (a point 90° preceding the Sun along the
ecliptic, and towards which the Earth’s motion is directed)
the meteors generally leave streaks, especially the brighter
ones, and move with great speed. They are usually white,
exhibiting a high degree of incandescence. If the radiant is
near the anti-apex or anywhere in the anti-apex half-sphere
the meteors are streakless, they travel slowly or very slowly,
and often leave trails of yellowish sparks. Bearing these
facts in mind the region may be assigned in which any
radiant is situated, if not the exact position of the radiant
itself. If, say, on Aug. 10, at midnight a swift, streaked
meteor is seen shooting from the Pleiades towards Aldebaran,
just risen, the radiant is either in Musca, Triangulum, or
Andromeda. But if the meteor is slow, with a train, then we
must go further back in the direction of its flight, and seek
the radiant in the S. or S.W. sky. If the motion is very
slow, the radiant may be as far away as Aquila. Second, <em>the
sensible position of the radiant</em>. A low radiant yields long-pathed
meteors, characterized by slowness of speed and a
flaky appearance either of the streaks or trains. A radiant
near the zenith gives short, darting meteors, with rather dense
streaks or trains. These nearly vertical meteors have a less
extensive range of atmosphere to penetrate than the horizontal
meteors, which are sometimes abnormally long. In
the case of brilliant meteors, however, the paths occasionally
extend over considerable arcs though the radiant may be high.
Third, <em>the position of the radiant relatively to the path of a meteor</em>.
If a meteor is close to its radiant its track is usually slow, and
appears greatly foreshortened by the effects of perspective.
It is travelling (approaching) nearly in the line of sight, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
the streak or offcome of sparks is especially dense because it
is seen through its entire depth; and the nucleus in such a
case has a brushy diffused appearance. Such meteors often
traverse sinuous, or curved paths of 2°, 3°, or 4°, and they
are readily distinguishable from other meteors far from
the radiants to which they belong.</p>

<p>A good method of tabulating meteor-tracks is that adopted
by Lieut.-Col. Tupman in his catalogue published by the
British Association in 1874. I have adopted the same form,
and herewith append a copy of my register of a few isolated
bright meteors observed in the autumn of 1890:—</p>

<p>The <em>duration of flight</em> is a most important element to estimate
correctly, as it affords data wherewith the real velocity
may be computed, and enables the nature of the orbit in which
the meteor is moving to be definitely assigned. This feature
is, however, one of the most difficult of all to derive with
satisfactory precision. In the case of very slow meteors
lasting several seconds, it is easy by means of a stop-watch,
or by other methods, to get the times of flight within narrow
limits of error, but the swifter class of meteors complete their
visible trajectories in the fraction of a second, and are gone
before any effort can be made to gauge their durations, so
that a value has to be attributed which is little better than a
mere guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>Every adopted radiant-point should be based on at least five
paths, unless the conditions are special, and these must show
a very definite centre, and present family resemblances. It is
often possible to detect a good centre from very few paths,
when the radiant is low on the horizon, or when it occupies
an isolated position.</p>

<p>In recording meteors the details of their appearances should
also be appended to the paths. Foreshortened and crooked
courses, fluctuations of brightness, halting motion, spark-trains,
phosphorescent streaks, broken streaks, and other
features must be invariably noted when observed, as likely
to assist in fully comprehending these bodies. A streak
will sometimes brighten up perceptibly after the head has
died out.</p>

<p>One of the principal aims of future observers should be to
ascertain the visible duration of meteor-showers, and the displacement
or fixed position of the radiants during the period
of their continuance. The Perseids seem to endure for forty-six
nights (July 8-August 22) while the radiant moves from
3° +49° to 76° +57°. The Lyrids also exhibit a shifting
radiant, and it is highly probable some other showers are to
be included in the same category. In investigating these,
the observations of single nights should be kept separate,
and the radiant determined from each set of paths. The
positions when compared will then exhibit the rate and direction
of the displacement. As to radiants which are apparently
stationary<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> during long intervals, these should be closely
observed. Are the centres of radiation, as successively
determined, identical, allowing for the slight errors of observation?
Are they continuously in operation, or intermittent?
Meteors with motions in declination and near their radiants
will be specially valuable in settling these questions, and if
observed at more than one station will possess great significance.
If it can be proved that a radiant is fixed and
continuous during a few weeks, there can be no reason why it
may not be stationary for a much more lengthy interval,
unless the circumstances are exceptional.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>
<p>Though I have pointed out the urgency of noting the
directions and durations of meteors, there are other features
in such observations that must not be disregarded. If the
paths are being recorded for the particular purpose of getting
duplicate observations and calculating the heights, then it is
desirable to note the beginning-and end-points of the flights
as exactly as possible, for unless this is done the combined
paths will show great discordances. Those who have acquired
a familiar knowledge of the constellations will, however,
experience little trouble in insuring accuracy in these records.</p>

<p>Observers, particularly those residing in towns, must be
constantly on their guard against mistakes in identifying
meteors from terrestrial objects such as fire-balloons and the
various forms of pyrotechnic display. That such caution is
necessary will be admitted when we read the two following
letters, which were published in the ‘Times’ some years
ago:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—</p>

<p>“A large meteor was seen to-night at 8.27, moving
very slowly along the northern horizon, from west to east, at
an altitude of about 8 deg. It was at least three times as
brilliant as Venus, remaining visible for nearly five minutes,
moving slower than any hitherto observed. I should be glad
to receive observations made at more favourable stations....</p>

<p class="psig">
<span class="padr4">“I remain, Sir, your obedient Servant,</span><br />

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—</p>

<p>“The ‘large meteor’ seen by Mr. Crumplen on Monday
evening at 8.27, three times as brilliant as Venus, and
moving from west to east, was a fire-balloon sent up shortly
after 8 o’clock from the Eton and Middlesex Cricket Ground,
Primrose Hill, as a <em>finale</em> to some athletic sports which had
taken place during the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p>In concluding this chapter I may briefly mention that an
old idea concerning meteors was that they originated gales of
wind, and that, in fact, they were the usual precursors of
stormy weather. This belief is thus expressed in Dryden’s
‘Virgil’:—</p>

<p>The planetary observer has to accept such opportunities as
are given him; he must use his telescope at the particular
seasons when his objects are well presented. These are
limited in number, and months may pass without one of them
coming under favourable review. In stellar work no such
irregularities can affect the progress of observations. The
student of sidereal astronomy has a vast field to explore, and
a diversity of objects of infinite extent. They are so various
in their lustre, in their grouping, and in their colours, that
the observer’s interest is actively retained in his work, and we
often find him pursuing it with unflagging diligence through
many years. No doubt there would be many others employing
their energies in this rich field of labour but for the uninteresting
character of star-disks, which are mere points of
light, and therefore incapable of displaying any detail. Those
who study the Sun, Moon, or planets have a large amount
of surface-configuration to examine and delineate, and this is
ever undergoing real or apparent changes. But this is wholly
wanting in the telescopic images of stars, which exhibit a
sameness and lack of detail that is not satisfying to the tastes
of every observer. True there are some beautiful contrasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
of colour and many striking differences of magnitude in
double stars; there are also the varying position and distance
of binary systems, the curious and mysterious fluctuations in
variable stars, and some other peculiarities of stellar phenomena
which must, and ever will, attract all the attention that
such important and pleasing features deserve. And these, it
must be conceded, form adequate compensation for any other
shortcomings. The observer who is led to study the stars by
comparisons of colour and magnitude or measures of position,
will not only find ample materials for a life-long research,
but will meet with many objects affording him special entertainment.
And his work, if rightly directed and accurately
performed, will certainly add something to our knowledge of
a branch in which he will certainly find much delectation.</p>

<p><i>Greek Alphabet.</i>—The amateur must, at the outset of his
career, thoroughly master the Greek alphabet. This will
prevent many time-wasting references afterwards, and avoid
the doubt and confusion that must otherwise result. The
naked-eye stars in each constellation have Greek letters affixed
to them on our celestial globes and star-maps.</p>

<p>The letters are applied progressively to the stars (generally
according to brightness) in each constellation. The 1st-mag.
stars frequently have a duplicate name. Thus α Leonis is
also known as Regulus, and α Canis Majoris as Sirius, the
Dog-star.</p>

<p><i>Learning the Names of the Stars.</i>—A knowledge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
stars as they are presented in the nocturnal sky may be
regarded as the entrance to the more advanced and difficult
branches of the science, and forms the young observer’s
introductory lesson. When he has learnt a few of the principal
constellations, and can point them out to his friends,
he already begins to feel more at home with the subject,
and regards it with a different eye to what he did before
when the names and configurations of the stars were alike
unknown to him. He no longer views the heavens as a
mysterious assemblage of confusing objects, for here and
there he espies certain well-known groups always preserving
the same relative positions to each other. The unconscious
gaze he formerly directed to the sky has given way to the
intelligent look of recognition with which he now surveys the
firmament.</p>

<p>An acquaintance with the leading constellations, and with
the names or the letters of the brighter stars in each, becomes
very important in some departments of observation, and
various methods have been suggested as likely to impress the
positions and names on the memory. The beginner must first
be content to get familiar with a few of the brighter stars,
and make these the base for extending his knowledge. The
objects are so numerous that it is impossible his primary
attempts can be anything like complete. He must advance
step by step in his survey, and feel his way cautiously, setting
out from certain conspicuous stars with which he has already
become conversant. A lantern and a series of star-maps are
the only aids required, and with these he ought to make satisfactory
progress. The stars as they are seen in the sky may
be compared with those figured in the maps, and their names
and the constellations in which they lie may then be identified.
It is an excellent plan as conducing to fix the positions
indelibly in the memory to construct maps from personal observation,
and to compare these afterwards with the published
maps for identification of the constituent stars. This plan, if
repeated several times, has the effect of impressing the
positions of the leading stars forcibly upon the observer’s
mind.</p>

<p>It is not intended to give, in this place, any details as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
the places or distribution of the stars. Without diagrams,
such a description could not be made readily intelligible. To
those, however, who are commencing their studies, I would
recommend the northern sky as the most suitable region to
aid their initiatory efforts. For</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The seven bright stars of Ursa Major are familiar to nearly
everyone. Two of them, called the Pointers, serve to direct
the eye to the Polar star, which, though not a brilliant one,
stands out prominently in a region comparatively bare of large
stars. It is important to know the Polar star, as it is situated
near the centre of the apparent motion of the firmament.
When the student has assured himself as to the northern stars
he will turn his attention southwards, and recognize the
beautiful Orion and the curious groups in Taurus. He will
also observe, much further east, the well-known sickle of Leo,
and in time become acquainted with the many other constellations
that make the winter sky so attractive.</p>

<p><i>The Constellation Figures.</i>—The observer will soon realize
that the creatures after which the constellations have been
named bear no resemblance to the configuration of the stars
they represent. If we look for a Bear amongst the stars of
Ursa, for a Bull amid the stars of Taurus, or for a flying Swan
in the stars of Cygnus we shall utterly fail to find it. The
names appear to have been originally given, not because of
individual likenesses between them and the star-groups to
which they are applied, but simply on account of the necessity
of dividing the sky into parts, and giving each a distinguishing
appellation, so that it might be conveniently referred
to. There were pressing needs for a system of stellar nomenclature,
and the plan of grouping the stars into imaginary
figures was the one adopted to avoid the confusion of looking
upon the sky as a whole. There are some who object to the
method of the Chaldean shepherds because the series of
grotesque figures on our star-maps and globes bear no natural
analogies. But it would be unwise to attempt an innovation
in what has been handed down to us from the myths of a
remote antiquity, for</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang small">(In measuring angles of position the larger star is always understood as
central in the field. The north point is zero, and the angles are
reckoned from this point towards the east. If a star has a faint
component lying exactly east or following it, then the angle is 90°;
if the smaller star is south, the angle is 180°; and so on.)</p></blockquote>


<p><i>Means of Measurement.</i>—A micrometer becomes an indispensable
instrument to those who make sidereal observations
of an exact character. Without such means it will be impossible
to determine either positions or distances except by mere
estimation, and this is not sufficiently precise for double-star
work. With a reliable micrometer<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> excellent results may
be obtained, especially with regard to the varying angles of
binary systems. Frequent remeasurement of these is desirable
for comparison with the predicted places in cases
where the orbits have been computed. In this department
of astronomy the names of Herschel, South, Struve, Dawes,
Dembowski, Burnham, and others are honourably associated,
and it is notable that refracting-telescopes have accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
nearly the whole of the work. But reflectors are little less
capable, though their powers seem to have been but rarely
employed in this field. Mr. Tarrant has lately secured a
large number of accurate measures with a 10-inch reflector
by Calver, and if care is taken to secure correct adjustment
of the mirrors, there is no reason why this form of instrument
should not be nearly as effective as its rival. Mr. Tarrant
advises those who use reflectors in observing double stars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> “to
test the centering of the flat at intervals during the observations,
as the slightest shift of the large mirror in its cell
will frequently occasion a spurious image which, if it by
chance happens to fall where the companion is expected to
be seen, will often lead to the conclusion that it has been
observed. In addition to this, any wings or the slightest
flare around a bright star will generally completely obliterate
every trace of the companion, especially if close and of small
magnitude, and such defects will in nine cases out of ten be
found to be due to defective adjustment. Undoubtedly for
very close unequal pairs the refractor possesses great advantages
over a reflector of equal aperture; in the case of close
double stars the components of which are nearly equal there
appears to be little, if any, difference between the two classes
of instruments; while for any detail connected with the
colour of stars the reflector certainly comes to the fore from its
being perfectly achromatic.” These remarks from a practical
man will go far to negative the disparaging statements sometimes
made with regard to reflectors and stellar work, and
ought to encourage other amateurs possessing these instruments
to take up this branch in a systematic way.</p>

<p><i>Dividing Power.</i>—This mainly depends upon the aperture,
and it was made the subject of careful investigation and
experiment by Dawes, who found that the diameters of the
star-disks varied inversely as the aperture of the telescope.
Adopting an inch as the standard, he ascertained that this
aperture divided stars of the sixth magnitude 4″·56 apart, and
on this base he constructed the following table:—</p>

<p>Dallmeyer, the optician, confirmed these values by remarking:—“In
all the calculations I have made, I find that
4·33 divided by the aperture gives the separating power.
Thus, 4·33 inches separates 1 ″.” But a good deal depends
upon the character of the seeing and upon other conditions.
A large aperture will sometimes fail to reveal a difficult and
close <i>comes</i> to a bright star when a smaller aperture will
succeed. This is due to the position of the bright diffraction-ring,
which in a large instrument may overlap the faint companion
and obscure it, while in a small one the ring falls
outside and the small star is visible<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>. Dawes concluded that
“tests of separation of double stars are not tests of excellence
of figure,” and he gave much valuable information with
regard to micrometers and double-star observations generally
in the ‘Monthly Notices,’ vol. xxvii. pp. 217-238. This
paper will well repay attentive reading.</p>

<p><i>Number of Stars.</i>—In the northern hemisphere there are
about 5000<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> stars perceptible to the naked eye. This is less
than an observer would suppose from a casual glance at the
firmament, but hasty ideas are often inaccurate. The scintillation
of the stars and the fact that many small stars are
momentarily glimpsed but cannot be held steadily have a
tendency to occasion an exaggerated estimate of their numbers.
Authorities differ as to the total of naked-eye stars. Sir R.
S. Ball says “the number of stars which can be seen with
the unaided eye in England may be estimated at about 3000.”
Gore gives 4000. Backhouse mentions 5600 as visible in the
northern hemisphere. Argelander, who has charted 324,188<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
stars between 2° S. of the equator and the N. pole, gives the
following numbers of stars up to the 9th magnitude:—</p>

<p>With every decrease in magnitude there is a great increase
in numbers, and if this is extended to still smaller magnitudes
down to the 15th or 16th we can readily understand that
there exist vast multitudes of fainter stars. Paul Henry, of
the Paris Observatory, says there are about 1,500,000 stars of
the 11th mag., and Dr. Schönfield, of Bonn, gives 3,250,000 as
of the 11½ mag. It is probable that by means of photography
and the largest telescopes considerably more than 50 millions
of stars may be charted, but this is a mere approximation.
Roberts has photographed 16,206 stars within an area of four
square degrees in a very rich region of the Galaxy near
η Cygni, and Gore computes that were the distribution equal
to this over the whole firmament the number of stars would
reach 167 millions. He also remarks that in the Paris photographs
of the Pleiades, 2326 stars are shown in a space
covering about three square degrees, and this gives for the
entire sky a total of 33 millions. It is, however, manifest
that unusually plentiful spots in the heavens cannot be
accepted as affording a criterion of the whole.</p>

<p><i>Magnitudes.</i>—According to Argelander’s figures, above
quoted, each magnitude exhibits a rise of about 300 per cent.
But authorities rarely agree as to scale, as the following comparison
between Sir J. Herschel and Struve will show:—</p>

<p>Argelander’s magnitudes come between those of Herschel
and Struve. Such disagreements are perplexing to observers,
and it is fortunate that in regard to the naked-eye stars we
are now furnished with a more consistent and accurate series
of magnitudes. Photometric determinations of the light of
4260 stars not fainter than the 6th mag., and between the N.
pole and 30° S. declination, were made at Harvard College
Observatory, and similar measures of 2784 stars between the
N. pole and 10° S. declination were effected at the Oxford
University Observatory, and the results published in 1885.
The two catalogues are in very satisfactory agreement, the
accordances within one tenth of a mag. being 31 per cent.,
within one quarter of a mag. 71 per cent., and within one
third of a magnitude 95 per cent. The photometers used in
the two independent researches were constructed on very
different principles, and the substantial agreement in the
results indicates that “a great step has been accomplished
towards an accurate knowledge of the relative lustre of the
stars” (‘Monthly Notices,’ vol. xlvi. p. 277).</p>

<p><i>The Milky Way.</i>—On dark nights when the Moon is absent
and the air clear, a broad zone of glimmering, filmy material
is seen to stretch irregularly across the heavens. It may be
likened to a milky river running very unevenly amongst the
constellations, and showing many curves and branches along its
course. On very favourable occasions the unaided eye glimpses
many hundreds of glittering points on this light background. A
field-glass reveals some thousands, and shows that it is entirely
composed of stars the blended and confused lustre of which
occasions that track of whiteness which is so evident to the
eye. In a good telescope stars and star-dust exist in countless
profusion, and great diversity is apparent in their numbers
and manner of grouping. In certain regions the stars are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
concentrated into swarms, and the sky is aglow with them;
while in others there are very few, and dark cavernous openings
offer a striking contrast to the silvery sheen of surrounding
stars. There are many of these void spaces in Scorpio,
and a circular one in Sagittarius R.A. 17<sup>h</sup> 56<sup>m</sup>, Dec.-27° 51´
has been particularly remarked. These inequalities of
grouping may be easily recognized with the naked eye, especially
in Cygnus, where bright star-lit regions frequently
alternate with dark void spaces. In the southern sky there
is a noteworthy instance. Near the brilliant stars of Crux
and Centaurus and closely surrounded by the Milky Way there
is a large black vacancy very obvious at a glance, and so
striking to ordinary observers that it is known as the “Coal-sack,”
a name applied to it by the early navigators of the
southern seas.</p>

<p>The course of the Milky Way may be described generally
as flowing through Auriga, the club of Orion, feet of Gemini,
western part of Monoceros, Argo Navis, Crux, feet of Centaurus,
Circinus, Ara, where it separates into two branches,
the western of which traverses the northern part of the tail of
Scorpio, eastern side of Serpens, Taurus Poniatowski, Anser,
and Cygnus. The eastern branch crosses the tail of Scorpio,
the bow of Sagittarius, Antinous, Aquila, Vulpecula, and then
enters Cygnus, where it reunites with the other branch. It
thence passes through Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Perseus, and
enters Auriga. In breadth it varies greatly, being in some
places only 4° or 5°, whereas in others it reaches 20°. It is,
of course, best visible when twilight is absent, but it is sometimes
very plain, even at midsummer, for at this season some
of its more conspicuous sections are favourably placed for
observation. It is supposed that fully nine tenths of the total
number of stars in the firmament are included within the
borders, of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Some of the ancient philosophers, including Democritus,
formed just conceptions as to the real nature of this appearance.
Though they lacked instruments wherewith to observe
the stars forming it, they yet saw them with the eye of
reason. But very vague and incorrect notions prevailed in
early times, when superstition was rife, as to many celestial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
phenomena. Some of the ancient poets and learned men
refer to the Galaxy as the path by which heroes ascended to
heaven. Thus we read in Ovid:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“A way there is in heaven’s extended plain,</div>
  <div class="verse">Which when the skies are clear is seen below,</div>
  <div class="verse">And mortals, by the name of Milky, know;</div>
  <div class="verse">The ground-work is of stars, through which the road</div>
  <div class="verse">Lies open to great Jupiter’s abode.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>Scintillation of the Stars.</i>—The rapid variations of light
known as the “twinkling” of the stars received notice from
many ancient observers, including Aristotle, Ptolemy, and
others, and they severally endeavoured to account for it, but
not in a manner altogether satisfactory. At low altitudes
bright stars exhibit this twinkling or scintillation in a striking
degree, but it is much less perceptible in stars placed at considerable
elevations. Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is
a noted twinkler. His excessive lustre and invariably low
position are conditions eminently favourable to induce this
effect. But the planets seldom exhibit scintillation in a very
marked degree. The light of Jupiter and Saturn is steady,
even when these planets are close to the horizon. Mercury,
however, twinkles most obviously, and Venus and Mars,
when low down, are often similarly affected, especially in
stormy weather when the air is much disturbed. Hooke,
in 1667, concluded that the scintillation was due “to irregular
refractions of the light of the stars by differently heated
layers of atmosphere.” M. Arago said it arose “from the
peculiar properties possessed by the constituent rays of light,
of moving with different velocities through the strata of the
atmosphere, and of producing what are called interferences.”
More recently, M. Montigney has conducted some interesting
researches into this subject, and he believes “that not only
is twinkling caused, to a great extent, by the deviations of
portions of a star’s light altogether away from us by variable
layers of atmosphere, but it is also affected, both in frequency
and in the colours displayed, by the nature of the light emitted
by the individual star.” The planets are little subject to scintillation,
as they present disks of sensible size, and thus are
enabled to neutralize the effect of atmospheric interferences.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
It is curious, however, that the steadiness of telescopic images
does not appear to be much improved at high altitudes, and
that the phenomenon of scintillation still operates powerfully
as observed from mountainous stations. In February 1888,
Dr. Pernter, of the Vienna Academy of Sciences, found “that
the scintillation of Sirius was actually greater at the top of
Sonnblick, 10,000 feet high, than it was at the base of the
mountain, and he formed the opinion that scintillation has its
origin in the <em>upper</em> strata of the atmosphere and not in the
lower as usually assumed.” It would appear from this that
lofty situations do not possess all the advantages claimed for
them in regard to the employment of large telescopes.</p>

<p><i>Star-Disks.</i>—The stars as observed in telescopes are shorn
of the false rays apparent to the naked eye, and they are seen
with small spurious disks. That the disks are spurious is
evident from the fact that the larger the telescope employed,
the smaller the star-disks become. And moreover, when a
star is occulted by the Moon, it disappears instantaneously.
There is no gradual diminution of lustre; the star vanishes
with great suddenness. Bright stars, like Aldebaran or
Regulus, have been watched up to the Moon’s limb, and observers
have been sometimes startled at the abruptness with
which they were blotted out. An appreciable disk could not
be withdrawn in this instantaneous manner; it would exhibit
a perceptible decadence as the Moon increasingly overlapped
it, but no such appearance is observed. On the occasion of
the occultation of Jupiter on Aug. 7, 1889, the planet’s diameter
was 41″·4, and the disappearance occupied 85 seconds.
Now had Aldebaran or Regulus a real disk of only 1″ it
would prevent their sudden extinctions, and their disappearances
would be spread over perceptible though short intervals of
time<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>. But there is every reason to conclude that the actual
disks are to be represented by a small fraction of 1″, so that
the largest instrument and the highest powers fail to reveal
it. In this connection, Mr. Gore, in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span> ‘Scenery of the
Heavens,’ p. 152, says:—“Let us take the case of α Centauri,
which is, as far as is known at present, the nearest fixed star
to the Earth. The distance of this star is about 25 billions
of miles. From comparisons made between its light and the
Moon, it has been found that its intrinsic brilliancy must be
about four times that of the Sun. Supposing its greater lustre
is due to its greater size—a not improbable supposition—it
would subtend, if placed at the Sun’s distance, an angle twice
as great, or about 1°, and hence we find that the angle subtended
at its distance of 25 billions of miles would be about
1/76th of a second of arc, which the most powerful telescope
yet constructed would be incapable of showing as a visible
disk.”</p>

<p><i>Distance of the Stars.</i>—The distances of the outer planets
Uranus and Neptune, mentioned in an earlier chapter of this
work, are sufficiently large to amaze us; but the distances of
the stars may be said to be relatively infinite. For many
years the problem of stellar distances defied all attempts to
resolve it. At length, in 1838-39, Bessell, Henderson, and
Struve obtained results for three stars—viz. 61 Cygni, α Centauri,
and α Lyræ,—which practically settled the question.
More recent measures of stellar parallax, while correcting the
earlier values, have virtually corroborated them; though the
figures adopted can only be regarded as approximations,
owing to the difficult and delicate nature of the work. The
binary star α Centauri appears to be the nearest of all; it
has a parallax of 0″·75, and its distance from us is equal to
275,000 times the distance of the Sun. Light traversing
space at the rate of 187,000 miles per second would occupy
4-1/3 years in crossing this interval. In the Northern hemisphere
61 Cygni is the nearest star, with a parallax of 0″·44 and
a distance of about 470,000 times the Sun’s distance. Light
would take more than seven years in reaching us from this
star, α Lyræ has a parallax of 0″·15, equal to nearly 22 light-years.
α Crucis shows a very small parallax (0″·03), and its
distance is excessively remote—equal to about 108 light-years!</p>

<p><i>Proper Motion of Stars.</i>—A very slight motion affects the
places of many of the so-called fixed stars. This must, after
the lapse of long intervals of time, materially alter the con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>figuration
of the constellations. But the change is a very
gradual one, and must operate through many centuries before
its effects will become appreciable in a general way. The
greatest proper motion yet observed is that in regard to two
small stars (one in Ursa Major and the other in Piscis
Australis), which amounts to about 7″ annually. Another
motion has been recognized, viz. in the line of sight. Dr.
Huggins made the initiatory efforts in this research by
measuring the displacement of the F line in the spectrum of
Sirius. The work has been actively pursued at the observatories
of Greenwich and Rugby, and with interesting
results. While certain stars exhibit a motion of approach,
others display a motion of recession. Thus Vega, Arcturus,
and Pollux are approaching us at the rate of about 40 miles
per second; while Rigel is receding at the rate of 17 miles
per second, Castor at the rate of 19, Regulus 14, Betelgeuse 25,
and Aldebaran 31. Sirius, in the years from 1875 to 1878,
was receding from us at the rate of 22 miles per second; but
this decreased in subsequent years, and in 1884-85 the star
was approaching with a motion of about 22 miles per second.
In 1886 and 1887 this rate was increased to about 30 miles
per second, as observed both at Greenwich and Rugby.
This confirms the idea that Sirius is moving in an elliptical
orbit. Similar observations, in regard to the variable star
Algol, have revealed that changes of velocity are connected
with its changes of lustre. Before minimum the star recedes
at the rate of 24½ miles per second, while after minimum the
star approaches with a speed of 28½ miles per second (‘Monthly
Notices,’ vol. 1. p. 241).</p>

<p><i>Double Stars and Binary Systems.</i>—Telescopic power will
often reveal two stars where but one is seen by the naked eye.
Sometimes the juxtaposition of such stars is merely accidental;
though they are placed nearly in the same line of
sight the conjunction is an optical one only, and no connection
apparently subsists between them. In other cases,
however, pairs are found which have a physical relation, for
one is revolving round the other; and these are termed <em>binary</em>
stars. Sir W. Herschel was the first to announce them, from
definite observations, in 1802. Of double stars more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
10,000 are now known; many of these are telescopic, but the
list includes some fine examples of naked-eye stars.</p>

<p>Double stars are excellent telescopic tests. A very close
pair affords a good criterion as to the defining capacity of an
instrument; while a pair more widely separated and of greatly
unequal magnitude, like that of α Lyræ, offers a test of the
light-grasping power. But in these delicate observations, as,
indeed, in all others, the character of the seeing exercises an
important and variable influence. A double star that is well
shown on one night becomes utterly obliterated on another,
owing to the unsteadiness and flaring of the image. On
such occasions as the latter one is reminded of the “twitching,
twirling, wrinkling, and horrible moulding” of which Sir
John Herschel complained, and which unfortunately forms a
too common experience of the astronomical observer. A close
double, of nearly equal magnitudes, requires a steady night,
such as is suitable for planetary details; but a wide double
consisting of a bright and a minute star rather needs a very
clear sky than the perfection of definition. Certain doubles,
such as θ Aurigæ, δ Cygni, and ζ Herculis, are often more
easily seen in twilight than on a dark sky; and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
experienced observers, conscious of this advantage, have secured
excellent measures in daylight. Mr. Gledhill says:—“Such
stars as γ Leonis and γ Virginis are best measured before
or very soon after sunset” (‘Observatory,’ vol. iii. p. 54).</p>

<p>The determination of the angles of position and distance of
double stars forms a very important and extensive branch of
work in connection with sidereal astronomy. In cases where
double stars preserve stationary places relatively to each other,
there is clearly no need for frequent re-observation. But in
those numerous instances where the two components form
a binary system it is desirable to obtain as many measures as
possible, so as either to verify the calculated orbit or to
furnish the materials for an orbit if one has not been computed
before. Dr. Doberck, whose name is well known in
these researches, mentioned, in 1882, that ample data for
purposes of computation had not been secured for more
than thirty or forty binaries out of between five and six
hundred such systems that were probably known to exist.
Sir W. Herschel, in 1803, estimated the period of revolution
of α Geminorum as 342 yrs. 2 mths. and of γ Virginis
as 1200 yrs. Orbits<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> do not appear, however, to have been
computed until 1827, when Savery of Paris showed that
the companion of ξ Ursæ Majoris was revolving in an ellipse
with a period of 58-1/4 years. The accomplished Encke also
turned his attention to this work, and adopted a more
elaborate method; and many others have pursued the subject
with very interesting and valuable results. On pp. 302-305 is
a selected list of some of the most noteworthy double and
binary stars, arranged according to the distance between the
components.</p>

<p>In compiling the above list, I have used some of the latest
measures available, as most of these doubles are binary systems,
and therefore in motion, so that a few years effect a perceptible
difference in the angles of position and distance of the
components. Some of the pairs are closing up, others are
opening, and thus it happens that a binary star, divided with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
great difficulty to-day, may become an easy object some years
hence, and <i>vice versâ</i>. In fact, as telescopic tests they are
constantly varying.</p>

<p>Before leaving this part of the subject it may be interesting
to refer individually to a few brilliant examples of double
stars.</p>

<p>α <i>Canis Majoris</i> (<i>Sirius</i>). A red star according to ancient
records, but it is now intensely white. In 1844 Bessel inferred
from certain little irregularities in the proper motion of this
star that it consisted of a binary system with a period of about
half a century<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>. Peters confirmed this idea in 1851, and it
was observationally verified eleven years afterwards. On
Jan. 31, 1862, Alvan Clark, jun., while testing a new 18½-inch
refractor, discovered a very faint companion 10″ distant.
Measures in the few subsequent years proved that the position-angle
was decreasing, while the distance showed a slight extension.
In 1872 it was about 11″·50, but since then the
two stars have been approaching each other, and Mr. Burnham’s
measures in April 1890 gave the distance as only 4″·19.
It is now, therefore, a very difficult object, and only visible in
large instruments. In England it is never easy, owing to its
southern position, and it has been little observed, but it is satisfactory
to note that the large refractors at Washington,
Princeton, and Chicago, U.S.A., have been often employed on
this object in recent years. Mann gives a period of 51·22
years for this interesting binary, and places the time of periastron-passage
as 1890·55. This differs from Gore’s orbit,
quoted in the table.</p>

<p>β <i>Orionis</i> (<i>Rigel</i>). A favourite test-object for small instruments.
The companion has been seen with only 1½-inch
aperture by experienced observers familiar with the object,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
and accustomed to its appearance in larger telescopes. The
beginner may, however, esteem himself fortunate if he distinguishes
the smaller star with 3 inches of aperture. When he
has done this he may afterwards succeed with 2½ inches only,
and quite possibly with 2 inches. He can ascertain his ability
in this direction by inserting cardboard diaphragms of the
diameters referred to in the dew-cap of his telescope. This
object is not a binary; the component stars are fixed relatively
to each other, and merely form an optical double. The colours
are pale yellow and sapphire blue. Burnham thought the
smaller star was elongated, as though a very close double, but
the 36-inch at Mount Hamilton has disproved the idea.</p>

<p>α <i>Lyræ</i> (<i>Vega</i>). Another well-known object, and one upon
which amateurs are constantly testing their means. The
companion star is extremely faint, and small instruments
would have no chance with it but for its comparatively wide
distance from Vega. Were it much nearer it would be
obliterated in the glare. This is a more difficult pair than
that of Rigel, though certain lynx-eyed observers have
glimpsed the minute star with ridiculously small apertures.
It is no mean feat, however, to discern the star with a 3-inch
telescope. Webb saw it more easily with a power of 80 than
with 144 on a 3-7/10-inch. There are many other stars in the
same field, though more distant than the companion alluded to.
With power 60 on my 10-inch reflector, I counted eighteen
stars in the field with Vega on Oct. 9, 1889, though the full
Moon was shining at the time. Several faint stars have been
alleged to exist much closer to Vega than the well-known
<i>comes</i>; but these have resisted the great American refractors,
and it may be safely assumed that they were ghosts produced
by a faulty image.</p>

<p>α <i>Ursæ Minoris</i> (<i>Polaris</i>). This double, from its constant
visibility in northern latitudes, from its unvarying brightness,
and from the relatively stationary positions of the stars composing
it, forms an excellent test for small instruments. But
it is a comparatively easy object, and ought to be seen in a
2-inch telescope. With this aperture the primitive efforts of
a young observer will probably be disappointing. If possible
he should first look at the pair through a 3-or 4-inch, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
then he will know exactly what he may expect to see with
inferior means. A difficult object is often readily glimpsed
in a small telescope after the eye has become acquainted with
it in a larger one. Experience of this kind is very requisite,
and it is by thus educating the eye that observers are gradually
enabled to reach objects which appeared hopelessly
beyond them at their first attempts. The companion to Polaris,
like that of Rigel and Vega, though situated in nearly the same
line of sight is not physically related to the larger star, the
contiguity of the objects being accidental. Some dubious
observations have been made of <i>comites</i> nearer to Polaris than
the one to which we have been adverting; but Burnham does
not see these, and we are forced to conclude that they have no
objective existence.</p>

<p>α <i>Scorpii</i> (<i>Antares</i>). A fiery-red star, with a rather close,
faint companion. This object being in 26° of S. declination
is rarely seen with advantage in places with latitudes far
north. Atmospheric disturbance usually affects the image
in such degree that the smaller star is merged in the contortions
of the larger. This pair is, however, interesting from
the circumstance that it is frequently liable to occultation by
the Moon. A night on which this double star can be distinctly
seen may be regarded as an exceptional one in point of
definition. It appears to have been discovered nearly half a
century ago by Grant and Mitchel.</p>

<p><i>Variable Stars.</i>—A proportion of the stars exhibit fluctuations
in their visible brightness. In most cases, however, the
variation is but slight, though there are instances in which
the differences are considerable. The fluctuations are periodical
in nature and capable of being exactly determined.
But the character of the variation and the period are very
dissimilar in different stars. Some are of short period, and
their variations occupy a few days only; others, however, are
more gradual, and twelve months or more may represent the
complete cycle of their changes. These alterations of brightness
generally escape the notice of casual observers of the
heavens. To them the stars appear as constant in their relative
magnitudes as they are in their relative positions. But a
close observer of the firmament, who habitually watches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
records the comparative lustre of the stars, must soon discover
numerous evidences of change. He will remark certain stars
which alternately grow bright and faint, and, in fact, display a
regular oscillation of brilliancy. In the case of a pair of stars
he may possibly notice that the superior lustre is emitted first by
one and then by the other. The observation of these variables
dates from a period anterior to the invention of the telescope.
Nearly three centuries ago Fabricius remarked that ο Ceti
(Mira) suffered a great diminution of light; for while it was of
the 3rd mag. in Aug. 1596, it became invisible in the following
autumn. It was re-observed by Holwarda in 1639, and as he
appears to have been the first to estimate its period, some
authors, including Argelander, have credited him with the
discovery. The star has a period of about 331·3 days. Its
variations are somewhat erratic, for at max. it is sometimes
only 4th mag., while at others it is as bright as 2nd mag.,
and its min. are equally inconsistent.</p>

<p>β Persei (Algol) is another and perhaps the best known of
all the variable stars. Its changes are very rapid, for it passes
through its various gradations of brilliancy in less than three
days. It was first noticed by Montanari in 1669, though it
was left for Goodricke in 1782 to ascertain its period. The
normal mag. of the star is 2·2, and it only shows distinct
variation during the five hours which precede and follow a minimum,
when it declines to 3·7 mag. Its period is shortening,
for in 1782 it was 2<sup>d</sup> 20<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup> 59<sup>s</sup>·4, in 1842, 2<sup>d</sup> 40<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup> 55<sup>s</sup>·2,
and at present Chandler finds it 2<sup>d</sup> 20<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup> 51<sup>s</sup>. As to the
causes which contribute to these variations, they are invested
in mystery. It has been conjectured that dark spots on the
surfaces of the stars may, by the effects of rotation, introduce
the observed alternations. Another surmise is that the temporary
diminutions of lustre are to be ascribed to the interposition
of dark satellites, and this theory seems tenable in
regard to stars of the Algol type. It is satisfactory to note
that a large amount of systematic work is being done in
this important and delicate branch of research. Such stars
as are subject to variation have been classed as follows:—1.
Temporary or new stars; 2. Stars having long and pretty
regular variation; 3. Stars irregularly variable; 4. Stars
varying in short periods; 5. Stars of the type of Algol,
which are liable to temporary diminutions of lustre. On
the preceding page is a list of the most noteworthy variable
stars.</p>

<p><i>New or Temporary Stars.</i>—These stars (sometimes classed
with variable stars) furnish us with rare instances of vast
physical changes occurring among sidereal objects, usually so
steadfast and endurable. The alternating lustre of certain
variable stars represents phenomena of regular recurrence,
and is probably to be explained by simple causes; but the
sudden outbursts and rapid decline of temporary stars
are facts of a more startling character, and need a more
exceptional explanation. The first of these objects recorded
in history appears to have been seen in Scorpio 134
years before the Christian era, and it suggested to Hipparchus
of Rhodes the idea of forming a catalogue of stars, so
that in future ages observers might have the means of recognizing
new stars or any other changes in the configuration of
the heavens. Hipparchus completed his catalogue in 128 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>;
it contained 1025 stars, and forms one of the most valuable
memorials we possess of the labours of the ancient astronomers.
Another temporary star is said to have appeared in 130 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>,
but this and several other objects of presumably similar character
noticed in later years may just possibly have been
comets, and considerable doubt hangs over the descriptions. It
will therefore be safest to confine our remarks to more modern
and better attested instances of these phenomena<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>:—</p>

<p>1572, November 11.—The famous star of Tycho Brahe.
He thus described his first view of it:—“One evening when
I was considering, as usual, the celestial vault, the aspect of
which is so familiar to me, I perceived with indescribable
astonishment a bright star of extraordinary magnitude near
the zenith in the constellation of Cassiopeia.” He adds:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>—“The
new star was destitute of a tail, or of any appearance of
nebulosity; it resembled the other stars in all respects, only that
it twinkled even more than stars of the first magnitude. In
brightness it surpassed Sirius, α Lyræ, or Jupiter. It could
be compared in this respect only to Venus when she is nearest
the earth (when a fourth part of her illuminated surface is
turned towards us). Persons who were gifted with good
sight could distinguish the star in the daytime, even at noon,
when the sky was clear.” This brilliant <span class="smcap lowercase">NOVA</span> began to fade
early in Dec. 1572, and in April and May 1573 it resembled
a star of the 2nd mag., in July and Aug. one of the 3rd
mag., and in Oct. and Nov. one of the 4th mag. In March
1574 the star completely disappeared (to the naked eye), after
a visibility of about 17 months. It exhibited some curious
variations of colour. It was white when most brilliant; it
then became yellow, and afterwards red, so that its hue in the
early part of 1573 was similar to that of Mars. But in May
it again became white, and continued so until it ceased to be
visible. The position of this star (for 1890) is R.A. 0<sup>h</sup> 18<sup>m</sup> 41<sup>s</sup>,
Dec. +63° 32′·2. It was supposed to be a reapparition of
the brilliant stars which shone between Cepheus and Cassiopeia
in 945 and 1264, and to have possibly been associated
with the “Star of Bethlehem;” but there is no reliable evidence
on which this view can be supported, as the alleged
“stars” of 945 and 1264 were undoubtedly comets, misdescribed
in old records. Cornelius Gemma is reputed to have
seen the celebrated star of 1572 a few days before Tycho
Brahe, viz., on November 8, 1572.</p>

<p>1604, October 10.—Discovered by Brunowski, who announced
it to Kepler. It was brighter than a star of the 1st
mag., also than Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn, which were not
far distant at the time. It did not begin to fade immediately;
for a month after its discovery it was still brighter than
Jupiter, and of a white lustre. At the middle of November
it surpassed Antares, but was inferior to Arcturus. In April
1605 it had fallen to the 3rd mag., and went on decreasing
until in October it could scarcely be seen with the naked eye
owing to the twilight resulting from its proximity to the Sun.
In March 1606 it was invisible. The position of this object
was about midway between ξ and 58 Ophiuchi, or at R.A.
17<sup>h</sup> 24<sup>m</sup>, Dec.-21° 207′ (1890).</p>

<p>1670, June 20.—Discovered by the Carthusian Monk Anthelme
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>in R.A. 19<sup>h</sup> 43<sup>m</sup> 3<sup>s</sup>, Dec. +27° 3′ (1890), a few degrees
east of β Cygni. It was of the 3rd mag., and continued in
view, with constantly fluctuating brightness, for nearly two
years. At the end of March 1672 it was 6th mag., and has
never reappeared. Hind found a small, hazy, and ill-defined
star in the same place, but this is probably not the same as
Anthelme’s star of 1670.</p>

<p>1848, April 28.—During the long interval of 178 years
separating 1670 from 1848 not a single new star appears to
have revealed itself. Observers had multiplied, astronomical
instruments had been much improved, star-catalogues were
plentiful, and yet the sidereal heavens gave no intimation of a
stellar outburst. No better proof than this could be afforded
as to the great rarity of temporary stars. At length, in the
spring of 1848, the spell was broken, and Mr. Hind announced
that a new star of a reddish-yellow colour had appeared in
Ophiuchus, R.A. 16<sup>h</sup> 53<sup>m</sup> 20<sup>s</sup>, Dec.-12° 43′ (1890). He
expressed himself as certain that no star brighter than the
9th mag. had been there previous to April 5. After rising to
the 4th mag. it soon faded, and in 1851 could only be observed
in large instruments. In 1875 it was still visible as a very
minute star.</p>

<p>1860, May 21.—M. Auwers, of Konigsberg, noticed a star
of the 7th mag. near the centre of the bright resolvable
nebula (M. 80), lying between α and β Scorpii, R.A.
16<sup>h</sup> 10<sup>m</sup> 29<sup>s</sup>, Dec.-22° 42′ (1890). On May 18 the star
was not there, and it disappeared altogether in three weeks.
It was independently seen by Pogson on May 28, and to him
it seemed that “the nebula had been <em>replaced</em> by a star, so
entirely were its dim rays overpowered by the concentrated
blaze in their midst.”</p>

<p>1866, May 12.—Discovered by Birmingham at Tuam. It
was of the 2nd mag., and situated in Corona, R.A. 15<sup>h</sup> 54<sup>m</sup> 54<sup>s</sup>,
Dec. +26° 14′ (1890). The outburst must have been very
sudden, as Schmidt, at Athens, was observing this region
three hours before the new star was detected, and is certain
it was then fainter than the 4th mag. The star was found to
be identical with one on Argelander’s charts estimated as 9½
mag. It faded from the 2nd to the 6th mag. by May 20, and
was thereafter invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<p>1876, Nov. 24.—A yellow star of the 3rd mag. was seen by
the ever vigilant Schmidt at Athens near ρ Cygni, and where
no such star existed on Nov. 20. The position of the object
was R.A. 21<sup>h</sup> 37<sup>m</sup> 23<sup>s</sup>, Dec. +42° 20′ (1890). It soon grew
fainter, so that on Dec. 13 it was of the 6th mag. and devoid
of colour. In the spectroscope it presented much the same
lines as Birmingham’s star of May 1866. In addition to the
continuous spectrum it showed bright lines of hydrogen.</p>

<p>1885, August 31.—Dr. Hartwig announced the appearance
of a star-like nucleus in the great nebula (M. 31) of Andromeda,
R.A. 0<sup>h</sup> 36<sup>m</sup> 43<sup>s</sup>, Dec. +40° 40′ (1890). Other observers
soon corroborated the discovery. The star appears to
have been first seen on Aug. 19; it was not visible on the
preceding night. On Sept. 1 its mag. was 6·5, on Sept. 2,
7·3, on Sept. 3, 7·2, Sept. 4, 8·0, Sept. 18, 9·2, &amp;c. On Feb.
7, 1886, it had dwindled down to the 16th mag., according to
an estimate made by Prof. Hall with the great Washington
refractor. The spectrum was continuous, and Proctor and
Gore considered “that the evidence of the spectroscope showed
that the new star was situated <em>in</em> the nebula.”</p>

<p>The phenomena presented by the temporary stars alluded
to are so different to those of ordinary variables that it is very
questionable whether they ought to be classed together. Our
knowledge of the former would no doubt progress more
rapidly were they specially looked for and more instances
discovered. Those who have acquired a familiar acquaintance
with the naked-eye stars should examine them as often as
possible with this end in view. Some of these objects lose
light so quickly that unless they are caught near the maximum
they are likely to escape altogether, and this shows the necessity
of being constantly on the alert for their appearance. I
have frequently, while watching for meteors, reviewed the
different constellations in the hope of picking up a new object,
but have never succeeded in doing so.</p>

<p><i>Star Colours</i> form another interesting department of sidereal
astronomy. It is obviously desirable to record the hues
presented, not only by double stars and binary systems, but
by isolated stars also, as changes of tint have been strongly
suspected. Cicero, Seneca, Ptolemy, and others speak of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
Sirius as a red star, whereas it is now an intense white; and
if we rely on ancient descriptions similar changes appear to
have affected some other prominent stars. But the old records
cannot be implicitly trusted, owing to the errors of transcribers
and translators; and Mr. Lynn (‘Observatory’, vol. ix.
p. 104) quotes facts tending to disprove the idea that Sirius
was formerly a red star. In the majority of cases double
stars are of the same colour, but there are many pairs in
which the complementary colours are very decided. Chambers
remarks that the brighter star is usually of a ruddy or orange
hue, and the smaller one blue or green. “Single stars of a
fiery red or deep orange are not uncommon, but isolated blue
or green stars are very rare. Amongst conspicuous stars
β Libræ (green) appears to be the only instance.” As an
example of fiery-red stars Antares may be mentioned; Aldebaran
is deep reddish orange, and Betelgeuse reddish orange.
Amongst the more prominent stars Capella, Rigel, and Procyon
may be mentioned as showing a bluish tinge, Altair and
Vega are greenish, Arcturus is yellow, while Sirius, Deneb,
Polaris, Fomalhaut, and Regulus are white. Mr. Birmingham
published a catalogue of “The Red Stars” in the ‘Transactions
of the Royal Irish Academy’, for August 1877, and Mr.
Chambers has a <em>working-catalogue</em> of 719 such objects in the
‘Monthly Notices,’ vol. xlvii. pp. 348-387. The region of
Cygnus appears to be especially prolific in red stars, and many
of these objects are variable. In a paper read at a recent
meeting of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific Mr. Pierson
stated that in binary systems where the stars are of equal
magnitude the colours are invariably the same, while those
differing in magnitude differ also in colour and the larger star
is always nearer the red end of the spectrum than its secondary.
In the estimation of star-colours reflecting-telescopes are very
reliable owing to their perfect achromatism.</p>

<p><i>Groups of Stars.</i>—Great dissimilarity is apparent in the
clustering of stars. The heavens furnish us with all gradations—from
the loose, open groups like that in Coma
Berenices, in the Pleiades, or in Præsepe, to the compact
globular clusters, in which some thousands of stars are so
densely congregated that considerable optical power is re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>quired
to disintegrate them. Some, it is true, yield more
easily than others. The great cluster (Messier 13) in
Hercules readily displays the swarms of stars of which it
is composed; but others are so difficult that it is only in
the largest instruments they are resolved into star-dust.
Further references to these wonderful objects will be made
in the next chapter, and some of the principal examples
described; our purpose here is to allude to a few of the
more scattered groups, and to some noteworthy instances
of multiple stars.</p>

<p><i>Coma Berenices.</i> A naked-eye cluster, consisting of many
stars, chiefly from the 5th to 6th mags. A telescope adds a
number of smaller stars. Nebulæ may be often swept up
hereabouts, as it is not far north of the rich nebulous region
of Virgo.</p>

<p><i>The Pleiades.</i> Six stars are usually distinguished by the
naked eye, and a seventh is occasionally remarked. Möstlin
(the instructor of Kepler) counted fourteen, Miss Airy has
drawn twelve, and Carrington, like Möstlin, saw fourteen.
In 1877 I distinctly made out fourteen stars in this group.
The telescope reveals a considerable number of small stars
and Tempel’s large nebula near Merope. Kepler saw thirty-two
stars with a telescope, and Hooke seventy-eight; but
Wolf, at Paris, after three years of unremitting labour with
a 4-foot reflector, catalogued 671 stars in the group. A
photograph, however, with a 12-inch refractor showed 1421
stars; and a more recent negative includes no less than 2326.
There is an interesting little triangle close to the brightest
star, Alcyone; and several of the leading stars are involved
in nebulosity, discovered by means of photography.</p>

<p><i>Præsepe.</i> A fine group of small stars, divisible by the
unaided eye on a clear night. Chambers says the components
are not visible without a telescope; while Webb
notes that the group is just resolvable by the naked eye.
Thirty-six stars were glimpsed with Galilei’s telescope; but
modern instruments show many more. Marth, using Lassell’s
4-foot reflector at Malta, discovered several faint nebulæ and
nebulous stars in this cluster.</p>

<p>χ <i>Persei.</i> Perceptible to the eye as a patch of hazy material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
lying between the constellations Cassiopeia and Persei. In
a telescope it forms a double cluster, and is one of the richest
and most beautiful objects that the sky affords. The tyro
who first beholds it is astonished at the marvellous profusion
of stars. It can be fairly well seen in a good field-glass, but
its chief beauties only come out in a telescope, and the larger
the aperture the more striking will they appear. It is on groups
of this character that the advantage of large instruments is
fully realized. The power should be very low, so that the
whole of the two clusters may be seen in the field. An
eyepiece of 40, field 65′, on my 10-inch reflector, presents
this object in its most imposing form.</p>

<p>κ <i>Crucis</i>. Sir J. Herschel’s observations at the Cape have
made this object familiar to northern observers. It is composed
of more than 100 stars, from the 7th mag. downwards;
and some of the brighter ones are highly coloured, so that the
general effect is greatly enhanced and fully justifies Herschel’s
statement that the group may be likened to “a superb piece
of fancy jewelry.”</p>

<p>ζ <i>Ursæ Majoris</i> (<i>Mizar</i>). This group is interesting both as
a naked-eye and as a telescopic object. There is a 5th mag.
star, named Alcor, about 11½′ distant from Mizar, and the
former was considered a good test-object for unaided vision
by the Arabian astronomers. But the star has probably
brightened; for it can now be easily seen, and certainly
offers no criterion of good vision. Mizar is a fine telescopic
double, the companion being 4th mag. and distant 14½″.
Any small telescope will show it, and there is another 8th
mag. star very near.</p>

<p>σ <i>Orionis</i>. This appears as a double-quadruple star, with
several others in the same field. A 3-inch will reveal most of
them, though some of the fainter stars in the group will be
beyond its reach.</p>

<p>θ <i>Orionis</i>. In the midst of the great nebula of Orion there
is a tolerably conspicuous quadruple star, the components of
which form a trapezium. This is visible in a 2-inch refractor.
In 1826 Struve discovered a fifth star, and in 1830
Sir J. Herschel found a sixth; these were both situated
a little outside the trapezium. All these stars have been seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
in a 3-inch telescope. The great 36-inch equatoreal at Mount
Hamilton has added several others; one was detected by Alvan
G. Clark (the maker of the object-glass) and another by
Barnard. These were excessively minute, and placed within
the trapezium. Barnard<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> has also glimpsed an extremely
minute double star exterior to the trapezium, and forming a
triangle with the stars A and C on the following diagram:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_63"></a>Fig. 63.</div>
<img src="images/i-00(57).jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">The Trapezium in Orion, as seen with the 36-inch refractor.</div>
</div>

<p>Several observers, including Huggins, Salter, and others,
had previously drawn faint stars in the interior of the trapezium;
but these could not be seen by Hall and Burnham
in the large refractors at Washington and Chicago, and were
thus proved to have no real existence. The new stars
observed in the 36-inch telescope are only just within the
limits of its capacity, and therefore cannot be identical with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
stars alleged to have been previously seen in small instruments.
The fifth and sixth stars in the trapezium have been
supposed to be variable, and not without reason; possibly the
others are equally liable to change, but this is only conjecture.
Sir J. Herschel says that to perceive the fifth and sixth stars
“is one of the severest tests that can be applied to a telescope”
(‘Outlines,’ 11th edit. p. 610); yet Burnham saw
them both readily in a 6-inch a few minutes before sunrise
on Mount Hamilton in September 1879.</p>

<p>β and ε Lyræ also form multiple groups, which will well
repay observation either with large or small telescopes.</p>

<p><i>Further Observations.</i>—Anyone who attempts to indicate
with tolerable fulness the methods and requirements of observation
in the stellar department of astronomy will find a
heavy task lies before him; and it is one to which he will be
unable to do justice in a small space, owing to the variety of
matters to be referred to and the necessity of being particular
in regard to each one. In what follows I shall merely make
very brief allusions, as it is hoped the description already
given of past work will be a sufficient guide for the future.
Moreover, those who take up a special branch of inquiry will
hardly rest content with the meagre information usually conveyed
in a general work on astronomy, but will consult those
authorities who deal more exclusively with that branch.
Double and binary stars may be said to form one department,
variable and temporary stars another, the colours of stars
a third, while many others may be signified—such as the
determination of star-magnitudes, positions, grouping, and
distances; also the proper motions and number of stars,
besides photographic and spectroscopic work,—each and all
of which comprise a field of useful and extensive inquiry.
The amateur will of course choose his own sphere of labour,
consistently with his inclination and the character of his
appliances. In connection with double stars, valuable work
yet remains to be done, though the Herschels and the Struves
gathered in the bulk of the harvest and Burnham has gleaned
much that was left. With regard to bright stars, it may be
assumed that very few, if any, close companions, visible in
moderately small glasses, now await discovery, unless, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
in cases where the star forms part of a binary system of long
period, and the epoch of periastron has fallen in recent years.
But with telescopic stars there must be many interesting
doubles, some of them binaries, still unknown. These should
be swept up and submitted to measurement. A great
desideratum in this branch is a new general catalogue of
double stars; for such a work would greatly facilitate
reference, and save the trouble of searching through different
lists in order to identify an object. Burnham has given
some practical hints on double-star work in the ‘Sidereal
Messenger,’ and his remarks are reproduced in that excellent
work ‘Astronomy for Amateurs.’</p>

<p>As to variable stars, some of these permit of naked-eye
estimation, others need a field-glass, and there are some
which require to be followed in a good telescope. The
observer who enters this department may either desire to find
new objects or to obtain further data with regard to old ones.
If the former, he cannot do better than watch some of the
suspected variables in Gore’s Catalogue of 736 objects, published
by the Royal Irish Academy. Whether suspected or
known variables are put under surveillance, the plan of comparison
will be the same. Several stars near the variable in
position, and nearly equal in light, should be compared with
it, and the differences in lustre, in tenths of a magnitude,
recorded as frequently as possible. The extent and period of
the variation will become manifest by a discussion of the
results. The comparison-stars should of course be constant in
light, and, if naked-eye stars, they may be selected from the
<cite>Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis</cite> or ‘Harvard Photometry.’ If
telescopic stars are required, then recourse must be had to
comprehensive charts such as Argelander’s <cite>Durchmusterung</cite>,
which includes stars up to 9½ mag. Variable stars of the
Algol type are especially likely to escape recognition, as they
retain a normal brilliancy except during the few hours near
the time of a minimum.</p>

<p>As to star-colours, it must be admitted that our knowledge
is in an unsatisfactory condition. The results of past observation
show discordances which are difficult to account for.
When, however, all the circumstances are considered, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
need feel no surprise at this want of unanimity. In certain
cases it is probable that actual and periodical changes occur
in the colours of stars, though absolute proof is still required.
Atmospheric variations unquestionably affect the tints of stars,
and some alterations depend upon altitude, for a celestial
object seen through the dense lower air-strata near the
horizon will hardly preserve the same apparent hues when
on the meridian. Telescopes are also liable to induce false
impressions of colour, and especially by the employment of
different eyepieces not equally achromatic. And the observer’s
judgment is sometimes at fault through physiological
influences, or he may have a systematic preference for certain
hues which little impress another observer. Those engaged
in this branch feel the want of a reliable and ready means of
comparison, and several have been tried; but there are
objections to their use, and it seems that the best objects are
furnished by the stars themselves. Let the observer study
the colours of well-known stars, and familiarize his eye with
the distinctions in various cases (also with the differences due
to meteorological effects &amp;c.); he will then gradually acquire
confidence, and may use these objects as standards. The
difficulty will be that they cannot be directly compared, in
the same field, with other stars; but relative differences may
be noted by turning the telescope from one object to the
other. This will be better than forming estimates on the
basis of an artificial method, which will sure to be troublesome
to arrange, and probably erroneous in practice. In some
stars the colour is so curious as to be attributed with difficulty,
and with regard to faint stars colour-estimates are often unreliable;
so that it is not desirable to go below the 9th mag.
unless a very large instrument is employed.</p>

<p>The necessity of being constantly on the look-out for
temporary stars has been already mentioned. There is also
the need for further observations of such of these objects
as still exist. They are, however, very minute, and the
observer will have to be careful as to their identity. Though
no great revival in brilliancy is to be expected, these objects
exhibited some singular fluctuations during their decline, and
it is important to keep them under view as long as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>Many other departments of sidereal work are best left to
the professional astronomer. The derivation of accurate star-places,
proper motions, distances, &amp;c. requires instruments of
great refinement and trained hands to use them. Researches
such as these do not come within the scope of ordinary
amateurs. But a vast field is open to them in respect to
double and variable stars; and the physical relations of many
of the former greatly intensify the interest in this branch, and
make it necessary to secure frequent observations.</p>

<p><i>Distinction.</i>—These objects, though classed together in catalogues,
offer some great distinctions which the observer will
not be long in recognizing. It was thought at one period
that all nebulæ were resolvable into stars<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>, and that their
nebulous aspect was merely due to the confused light of
remote star-clusters. But modern telescopes, backed up by
the unequivocal testimony of the spectroscope, have shown
that purely nebulous matter really exists in space. The
largest instruments cannot resolve it into stars, and it yields
a gaseous spectrum. The conjecture has been thrown out
that it may be considered as the unformed material of which
suns and planets are made.</p>

<p><i>Large Number visible.</i>—D’Arrest once said that nebulæ are
so numerous as to be infinite, and his opinion is supported by
the rapid increase in the number known. Let us make a
comparison. Messier inserted in the <cite>Connaissances des
Temps</cite> for 1783 and 1784 (published in 1781) a catalogue
containing 103 nebulæ and star-clusters. Of these 68 were
new. In 1888 a new edition of Sir J. Herschel’s catalogue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
of 1864 (revised and extended by Dreyer) was printed by the
Royal Astronomical Society, and this includes 7840 objects!<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
The labours of the Herschels, of Lord Rosse, D’Arrest, Marth,
Tempel, Stephan, and Swift have vastly augmented our
knowledge in this branch since the time of Messier.</p>

<p><i>Varieties of Form and Grouping.</i>—A telescope reveals all
grades of condensation in stellar groups. Some consist of
rather bright, scattered stars, and are easily resolved. Others
contain more stars, but they are smaller, and greater power
is required to show them. Others again are condensed into
globular clusters needing high powers and good instruments
to disconnect the mass of stars composing them. Some are
faint, and the stars so minute that they are only to be distinguished
from nebulæ in the finest telescopes. As to the
nebulæ properly so called, they exist in all forms. They may
be either round, elliptical, or in the form of a streak. Some
are highly condensed in their centres, others present well-defined
circular disks like planets, and a small proportion are
in the form of rings<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>. Many peculiarities of detail have been
remarked, and a curious and complicated spiral structure has
been discovered in certain prominent nebulæ. One of these
has been termed the “Whirlpool” Nebula from its singular
convolution of form. Other objects have received distinctive
appellations agreeably to their appearance. Thus, there is the
“Dumb-bell” Nebula, the “Crab” Nebula, the “Horseshoe”
Nebula, &amp;c. Lord Rosse’s 6-foot reflector is in a large degree
responsible for the particular knowledge we possess of many
of these objects. The large mirror commands a grasp of light
which renders it very effective on forms of this character.
An instrument of small diameter is quite inadequate to deal
with them. They can be seen, it is true, and the general
shape recognized in the most conspicuous examples, but their
details of structure are reserved for the greater capacity of
large apertures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>—With regard to distribution these objects
exhibit the utmost irregularity, for in certain regions of the
heavens they are found to be very plentiful, while in others
they are singularly rare. Thus, in Virgo, Coma Berenices,
Leo, and Ursa Major large numbers of nebulæ abound, while
in Hercules, Draco, Cepheus, Perseus, Taurus, Auriga, &amp;c.,
very few are encountered. Taking the 7840 objects in
the New General Catalogue of 1888 it will be found that
their distribution in hours of Right Ascension is as follows:—</p>

<p><i>Early Observations.</i>—The nebula in Andromeda appears to
have been the one first discovered, for the distinguished Persian
astronomer Al-Sûfi (who died in 986 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) was undoubtedly
acquainted with it. The nebula is figured upon a Dutch map
of the stars nearly 400 years old. In 1612 Simon Marius
redetected this object, and appropriately likened its appearance
to that of a “candle shining through a piece of horn.”
In 1618 the nebula in Orion was certainly known, for Cysatus
of Lucerne compared it with the head of the fine comet
visible in December of that year. Huygens alighted upon
the same object in 1656, and appears to have been unconscious
of its prior discovery. Only six “nebulæ or lucid spots”
were known in 1716, and enumerated by Halley in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span> ‘Phil.
Trans.’ vol. xxix. These included those of Andromeda and
Orion. A third was situated in the space between the bow
and head of Sagittarius. This is M. 22, and consists of a
bright globular cluster of Stars. The fourth was the fine star-group
involving ω Centauri, which Halley himself found in
1677. The fifth was another fine group in the right foot of
Antinous. This is M. 11, and was discovered by Kirch in
1681. The sixth was the magnificent globular cluster (M. 13)
in Hercules, discovered by Halley in 1714.</p>

<p>In 1735 the Rev. W. Derham published a list of 16 of
these objects, and in 1761 Lacaille summarized 42 nebulæ
and star-clusters which he had observed in the southern sky.
This was followed by Messier’s tables of 45 nebulæ &amp;c. in
1771, and of 103 in 1781<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>. But these contributions, important
though they severally were, sunk into insignificance
beside the splendid results obtained by Sir W. Herschel, who
during his prolonged and systematic sweeps of the heavens
picked up no less than 2500 new nebulæ and clusters which
he formed into three catalogues printed in the ‘Phil. Trans.’
as follows:—1786, 1000 objects, 1789, 1000 ditto, 1802, 500
ditto.</p>

<p><i>Variable Nebulæ.</i>—It is in the highest degree probable that
changes occur in the physical appearances of certain nebulæ,
though the opinion is not perhaps supported by a sufficient
number of instances. Until Sir W. Herschel began his
review of the heavens very few nebulæ were known, and the
information possessed about them was very incomplete.
The early records, obtained with small and inferior telescopes,
scarcely admit of comparison with recent observations, for in
matters of detail little agreement will be found; and this
proceeds certainly not so much from real changes in the
objects as from differences due to the variety of instruments
employed, to atmospheric vagaries, and to “personal equation.”
Bullialdus and Kirch in 1667 and 1676 and Le Gentil in
1759 supposed that remarkable changes were operating in the
great elliptical nebula of Andromeda. But G. P. Bond fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
investigated the evidence, and concluded that the variability of
the object was by no means proved. Some observers have
represented the nucleus as stellar, while others have drawn it
as a gradual condensation, and Dr. Copeland has shown that
different magnifying powers alter the aspect of the nucleus,
“the lower powers making it more star-like, the higher ones
more soft-looking and extensive.”</p>

<p>Mairan and others entertained the view that the large
irregular nebula in Orion was subject to change. This object
received much attention from Sir W. Herschel, and he concluded
that it underwent great alteration between 1774 and
1811. D’Arrest, from his own researches and a discussion of
other results, expressed himself in 1872 that “the observed
changes in this vast mass of gas seem exclusively to turn out
to be temporary fluctuations of brightness.” Prof. Holden
has arrived at a similar conclusion, and says:—“The figure
of the nebula has remained the same from 1758 till now (if
we except a change in its apex about 1770, which seems quite
possible); but in the brightness of its parts undoubted variations
have taken place, and such changes are still going on”<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
(‘Monograph of the Nebula in Orion,’ p. 225).</p>

<p>Hind discovered a faint nebula, with a diameter of about 1′,
on Oct. 11, 1852. It was situated in Taurus, the position
being R.A. 4<sup>h</sup> 15<sup>m</sup> 33<sup>s</sup>, Dec. +19° 15′·6 (for 1890), or
about 2° W. of the star ε Tauri (mag. 3·7). D’Arrest, on
Oct. 3, 1861, searched for this object, but found it had
quite disappeared! A small round nebula was seen in 1868,
about 4′ preceding Hind’s, but this resisted some later attempts
at observation. In Oct. 1890, Burnham and Barnard, with
the 36-inch refractor of the Lick Observatory, saw two nebulæ
here, one a very small, condensed nebula, with a stellar
nucleus, and the other an exceedingly faint nebulosity about
45″ in diameter (see ‘Monthly Notices,’ vol. li. pp. 94, 95).</p>

<p>The nebula surrounding the star ζ Argûs has been suspected
of variation, particularly by Abbott, of Hobart Town,
Tasmania. Vols. xxv., xxx., and xxxi. of the ‘Monthly
Notices’ contain many references to, and figures of, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
interesting object. But the alleged changes have not been
substantiated, and there seems no reason to doubt that they
were purely imaginary.</p>

<p>The trifid nebula in Sagittarius (M. 20) is supposed by
Prof. Holden to have altered its position with reference to a
triple star now situated in the S. following part of the nebula.
Sir J. Herschel, more than half a century ago, had described
this star as placed in the middle of the vacuity by which the
nebula is divided. Dreyer, however, points out that the
drawings of this object differ in many details, and that,
though changes of brightness may have taken place, it is
difficult to understand that the nebula should move so as
to envelop the star in about 1835, “after which no sensible
change occurred again, so far as published observations go.”</p>

<p>The nebula (M. 17) just N. of the bow of Sagittarius
was also inferred by Holden to have shifted its place relatively
to the small stars figured by Lassell in this object;
but Dreyer adduces facts which controvert this assumption.
(See ‘Monthly Notices,’ vol. xlvii. pp. 412-420, where much
valuable information will be found as to supposed variable
nebulæ.)</p>

<p>On Oct. 19, 1859, Tempel discovered a faint, large nebulosity
attached to the star Merope, one of the Pleiades,
and at first mistook it for a diffused comet. Its position is
R.A. 3<sup>h</sup> 39<sup>m</sup>·6, Dec. +23° 26′ (1890). An impression soon
gained ground that this object was variable; for while
Schmidt, Chacornac, Peters, and others saw it with small
instruments, it could not be discerned by D’Arrest and
Schjellerup with the large refractor at Copenhagen. Swift
saw the nebula easily in 1874 with a 4½-inch refractor, and
has observed it with the aperture contracted to 2 inches.
Backhouse re-observed it in 1882 with a 4-1/4-inch refractor.
Yet in March 1881 Hough and Burnham sent a paper to the
Royal Astronomical Society with an endeavour to prove that
the nebula did not exist! They had frequently searched for
it during the preceding winter, but not a vestige of the object
could be seen in the 18½-inch refractor at Chicago, and they
regarded the supposed nebula as due to the glow proceeding
from Merope and neighbouring stars. But photography has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
entirely refuted this negative evidence, and has shown, not
only Tempel’s nebula, but others involving the stars Maia,
Alcyone, and Electra belonging to this cluster. As to the
alleged variations in the Merope nebula, there is every reason
to suppose these were not real.</p>

<p>Proper motion has been suggested in regard to a very
small, faint nebula (N.G.C. 3236) a few degrees following
α Leonis. But Dreyer has disproved this by showing that
there was no proper motion between 1865 and 1887, whence
“it may be safely inferred that there has been none since
1830, unless we are to believe, in this and similar cases, that
nebulæ in the good old days moved about as they liked, but
have been on their good behaviour since 1861.”</p>

<p><i>Nebulous Stars.</i>—This name was applied by Hipparchus
and other ancient observers to the clusters of stars which, to
the naked eye, appear as patches of nebulous light. Sir W.
Herschel, in 1791, showed this designation to be incorrect,
and used it in connection with stars actually involved in
nebulosity. In sweeping the heavens he met with several
instances of this kind. Thus, 3° E.S.E. of ζ Persei he found
a star of the 9th mag. surrounded by a nebula 3′ in diameter.
He picked up another close to the star 63 Geminorum. This
is a remarkable object—a star of the 9th mag. surrounded by
two dark and two bright rings. On Feb. 3, 1864, Lord
Rosse’s telescope showed an opening in the outer bright ring,
and the latter seemed connected with the inner bright ring;
so that the object presented the aspect of a spiral nebula with
a star in the centre. The diameter of the whole nebulosity is
45″. Key observed this object with an 18-inch reflector in
1868, and described it as symmetrical—a central star, with
intervening dark and bright rings. He found a power of 510
the best, for, “like the annular nebula in Lyra, it bears magnifying
wonderfully well.” Since Herschel’s time many
nebulous stars have been discovered. There is one of about
6th mag. in R.A. 8<sup>h</sup> 6<sup>m</sup>·1, Dec.-12° 36′. The nebulosity
round the star fades away gradually, and its extreme diameter
is 157″. There is a 7th mag. star at R.A. 21<sup>h</sup> 0<sup>m</sup> 14<sup>s</sup>, Dec.
+67° 44′ involved in a very large, faint nebulosity. This
is a striking object, and I have frequently picked it up while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
comet-seeking. The star has such a foggy, veiled appearance
that on first remarking it the observer thinks his lenses are
dewed, but on viewing neighbouring stars he sees them sharp
and clear on the dark sky, and the contrast is very pronounced.
The nebulous star is much isolated, though in a
part of the sky where small stars abound. This is one of
Herschel’s discoveries and No. 7023 of the N. G. C.; Dreyer
says he has seen the nebulosity particularly distinct north and
south of the star. In some cases a double star is involved
in nebulosity, and there are instances in which two double
stars are placed within an elliptical nebula.</p>

<p><i>The Magellanic Clouds</i><a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>.—These are marked as Nubecula
Major and Nubecula Minor on celestial globes and charts.
They form two extensive aggregations of nebulæ and star-clusters,
and are readily visible to the naked eye in or near
Hydrus, and not far from the south pole of the heavens.
They may be likened to detached patches of the Milky Way.
Sir J. Herschel says the Nubecula Major is situated between
the meridians of 4<sup>h</sup> 40<sup>m</sup> and 6<sup>h</sup> and the parallels of 66°
and 72° of S. declination, and extends over a space of some
42 square degrees. The Nubecula Minor lies between
0<sup>h</sup> 28<sup>m</sup> and 1<sup>h</sup> 15<sup>m</sup> and 72° and 75° of S. declination,
and spreads over about 10 square degrees. The composition
of these objects is very complex and diversified, and affords
very rich ground for exploration with a large telescope.
Nebulæ exist in profusion and in every variety, and are
intermingled with star-clusters varying in condensation from
the compact globular form to groups more loosely scattered,
and such as we often find in the Milky Way. Nearly three
hundred nebulæ and clusters are included in the major
“cloud,” while more than fifty others closely outlie its
borders. In the minor about forty such objects have been
discovered. It is very strange to find them collected together
in this manner; for in other regions of the firmament they are
usually found separated, and certain classes appear to have
their own special zones or localities of distribution. Sir J.
Herschel pointed out that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span> “globular clusters (except in one
region of small extent) and nebulæ of regular elliptic forms
are comparatively rare in the Milky Way, and are found congregated
in the greatest abundance in a part of the heavens
most remote possible from that circle, whereas in the Nubeculæ
they are indiscriminately mixed with the general starry ground
and with irregular though small nebulæ.”</p>

<p><i>Double Nebulæ.</i>—Instances are not wanting of conspicuous
double nebulæ. M. 51 and 76, near ζ Ursæ and θ Andromedæ,
may be classed in this category. There is a very interesting,
though a smaller object just W. of α and β Geminorum, or in
R.A. 7<sup>h</sup> 18<sup>m</sup>·6, Dec. +29° 43′. Two bright, round nebulæ
are separated by an interval of 28″. These double nebulæ
are usually round, and are sometimes resolvable into stars.
Whether they are physical or mere optical pairs has yet to
be ascertained. So many examples exist that it seems highly
probable they have a real connection, though no motion has
yet been certainly detected to prove they are binary systems.
Such motion may, however, be very slow, and require observations
extending over a much longer interval before it is
revealed.</p>

<p><i>Real Dimensions of Nebulæ and Clusters.</i>—It may be readily
imagined that these objects are of immense size; for though
placed at distances of the utmost remoteness, they spread over
perceptible and comparatively large areas. Gore remarks
that, on the assumption that the globular cluster in Hercules
(M. 13) is 5′ in diameter, and its parallax one tenth of a second,
its real diameter must be 3000 times the Sun’s mean distance
from the Earth, or nearly 280 billions of miles! He further
points out that, though this group contains as many as
14,000 stars, according to Sir W. Herschel, yet each component
may be separated many millions of miles from the
others, owing to the vast dimensions of the group. Details
like these are of course only approximate, as the distance of a
nebula or star-cluster has not yet been definitely ascertained.
The great nebulæ of Orion and Andromeda must extend over
prodigious regions in distance-space; but to quote figures
seems useless, in consequence of our inability to form just
conceptions of such immensity.</p>

<p><i>Round Nebulæ and Clusters.</i>—Resolvable nebulæ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
clusters are frequently circular in outline. The central condensation
is an indication of their globular form, though not
always so, for many of these objects become suddenly much
brighter in the middle, and show an apparently stellar nucleus.
The material or stars forming the object cannot therefore be
equally distributed. Where it suddenly brightens there is a
great condensation, and in some cases several of these are
evident in the form of bright rings, intensifying as the nucleus
is approached. This irregular aggregation denotes the operation
of “a force of condensation directed from all parts towards
the centre of such systems.” In regard to planetary nebulæ,
they cannot be globular or they would exhibit a brightness
increasing from the margin to the centre. Their even luminosity
throughout affords the evidence of a special structure.
Sir J. Herschel thought the planetary nebula (M. 97) near
β Ursæ Majoris must either be in the form of a hollow globe
or a flat circular disk lying perpendicular to the line of vision.</p>

<p><i>Description of Nebulæ and Clusters of Stars.</i>—The latter
objects are included in this chapter for several reasons. In a
small telescope nearly all such clusters exhibit the aspect of
nebulæ, and they have been catalogued with them, though, as
already explained, some great distinctions are to be drawn. To
the naked eye the cluster Præsepe, in Cancer, is usually visible
as a patch of nebulosity, though on a very clear, dark night stars
may be glimpsed sparkling about the spot, and a very small
glass will suffice to show it as a nest of stars. This object, and
some others of a more difficult character (their component
stars being smaller and more compressed), are tabulated (I.)
at the end of this chapter. A summary (II.) of globular
clusters is also given, together with a list (III.) of nebulæ, a
few of which are resolvable into stars<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>. It must be understood
that these selections, though comprising many notable
objects, are by no means exhaustive, the intention being
merely to indicate some typical examples of fine nebulæ and
clusters and of peculiarities of form or appearance, such as
planetary, annular, elliptical, and centrally condensed nebulæ
and loose, compressed, and globular clusters. Some of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
objects deserve individual references, as they present interesting
details to the telescopic observer and come within the reach
of moderate appliances.</p>

<p><i>Great Nebula in Andromeda</i> (M. 31). This object has
often been mistaken for a comet, for it is readily perceptible
to the eye on a moonless night. It is very large—4° by 2½°,
according to Bond, with a 15-inch refractor. He discovered
a pair of dark streaks in the brightest region of the nebula,
and these may be well seen in a 10-inch reflector. It is
really triple; for about 25′ S. of the nucleus there is a very
bright, round, resolvable nebula, discovered by Le Gentil, and
a third, observed by Caroline Herschel, lies rather further to
the N.W. Photographs by Roberts show dark rings dividing
the bright interior parts of the nebula from the outer, and
imparting to it a decided spiral tendency. This nebula has
hitherto resisted attempts to resolve it into stars, though
many hundreds have been seen in the foreground. But its
spectrum is continuous, so that its stellar character is to be
inferred.</p>

<p><i>Great Nebula in Orion</i> (M. 42). Visible to the naked eye
just below a line connecting β and ζ Orionis, and involving
θ Orionis. It exhibits an extremely complicated structure,
and many of its irregular branches and condensations may be
discerned in small instruments. Sir W. Herschel failed to
resolve this object into stars with his 4-foot reflector; but
Lord Rosse, in 1844, thought he had effected it with his
6-foot mirror, though the conclusion was premature. The
spectroscopic researches of Huggins have shown this nebula
to be composed of incandescent gases, so that the stars telescopically
observed in it are probably in the foreground and
entirely disconnected from the nebulous mass. Effective
photographs have been taken of it by Draper, Common, and
Roberts. It certainly forms one of the grandest objects in
the heavens.</p>

<p>The <i>Planetary</i><a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> <i>Nebula</i> (M. 97). Discovered by Mechain
in 1781. In small telescopes it looks like a rather faint, round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
mass of nebulosity, somewhat brighter in the middle than at
the edges. In Lord Rosse’s telescope it shows many details,
including a spiral arrangement and two dark spots in the
middle inclosing bright, eye-like condensations. The margin
is fringed with protuberances, and from its peculiar aspect
this object has been called the “Owl” Nebula. Diameter
between 155″ and 160″. It may readily be picked up 2-1/4°
S.E. of β Ursæ Majoris. It yields a gaseous spectrum.</p>

<p>In Draco at R.A. 17<sup>h</sup> 58<sup>m</sup> 36<sup>s</sup>, Dec. +66° 38′ there is a
pretty small, but exceedingly bright planetary nebula. With
a low power it looks like a star out of focus, but a high power
expands it into a well-defined planetary disk. As observed in
Lord Rosse’s 3-ft. reflector on Sept. 17, 1873, this nebula
exhibited “a round, well-defined disk of a full blue colour,
light very equable, diameter 22″·4, surrounded by an extremely
faint nebulosity.” This is an excellent object of its class.</p>

<p><i>Spiral Nebula</i> (M. 51). Discovered by Messier on Oct. 13,
1773. It is situated in Canes Venatici, and 4° S.W. from
ζ Ursæ Majoris. An ordinary instrument will reveal it as a
double nebula, and the two parts will be seen to differ greatly
in size. Messier gave the distance separating them as 4′ 35″.
Sir J. Herschel drew this object as a bright, centrally condensed
nebula, surrounded by a dark space and then by a
luminous ring divided through nearly one half of its circumference.
Closely outlying this he placed a bright round
nebula. Lord Rosse’s 6-foot showed something very different.
In April 1845 its spiral character was discovered; coils of
nebulosity were observed tending in a spiral form towards the
centre, and the outlying nebula was seen to be connected with
it. Some striking drawings have been published of this
object. Those by Sir J. Herschel and Lord Rosse differ
essentially, and would scarcely be supposed to represent the
same nebula; but when we reflect that the instruments used
were respectively of 18 inches and 72 inches aperture, the cause
of the disparity becomes evident.</p>

<p>Another fine example of a spiral nebula is M. 99, in the
northern wing of Virgo, and 8° E. of β Leonis. This object
was discovered by Mechain; its spiral form of structure
was detected by Lord Rosse in 1848. Diameter 2½′ Like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
M. 51 it gives a continuous spectrum and is resolvable into
stars.</p>

<p><i>The Crab Nebula in Taurus</i> (M. 1). Discovered by Bevis in
1731, and situated 1° N.E. of ζ Tauri. Its diameter is 5½′ by
3½′. An early drawing with Lord Rosse’s telescope shows it
with numerous radiations; whence it was termed the Crab
Nebula, from the supposed resemblance: but later observations
have given it quite another form. In 1877 there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
no trace of the nebulous arms: it appeared as a well-defined,
oval nebula with some irregularities of structure. This object
is very plain in small telescopes, and may be readily picked up
from its proximity to ζ Tauri; but in such instruments
it is void of detail, and merely presents a pale, oval nebulosity.
It has not been clearly resolved, though it has a
mottled appearance, indicating a stellar composition, in large
apertures.</p>

<p><i>The Dumb-bell Nebula</i> (M. 27). Discovered by Messier in
1779, and situated in Vulpecula—a region very rich in small
stars. Diameter about 7′ or 8′. Its general form resembles
a dumb-bell or hour-glass; hence its name. Struve, Lord
Rosse, and others have seen many stars in the nebulous mass,
but the latter is not resolvable. I have seen seven stars in
the nebula with a 10-inch reflector. Its peculiar shape is
perceptible in a small instrument. This object frequently
serves to illustrate books on Astronomy; but the drawings by
Sir J. Herschel, Lord Rosse, and others are curiously discordant,
and show how greatly differences in telescopic power
may affect the observed appearance of an object.</p>

<p><i>The Ring-Nebula in Lyra</i> (M. 57). Discovered by Messier
between the stars β and γ Lyræ. Diameter 80″ by 60″.
This object is bright, though rather small, and it will stand
high powers. The dark centre may possibly be glimpsed in
a 3-inch refractor; I have seen it readily in a 4-1/4-inch. It
was at one period thought to be resolvable, but the spectroscope
has negatived the idea, and shown it probably consists
of nitrogen gas. A small star near the centre was frequently
seen in Lord Rosse’s telescope; but the 36-inch refractor at
Mount Hamilton reveals twelve stars projected on or within
the ring, and several others have been suspected. There is a
faint star exterior to the ring, and following it; this is visible
in small telescopes. The space within the ring is not quite
dark, and the structure of the nebula is somewhat complicated
as seen in large instruments. Another fine instance of
an annular nebula may be found 3° preceding the 4th mag. star
41 Cygni, but it is not so large or conspicuous as that in
Lyra. Its diameter is 47″ by 41″. Several stars were
seen sparkling in it by Lord Rosse, who found the centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
was filled with faint light and the N. side of the ring broadest
and brightest.</p>

<p><i>Elliptical nebulæ</i> are well represented by the pair (M. 81
and 82) about 2° E. of δ (22) Ursæ Majoris. They are
separated by about 38′ of declination, so that they may be
observed in the same field of a low-power eyepiece. The
preceding one is very bright and large (8′ by 2′). The
following one is a ray or streak of nebulosity (7′ by 3/4′). On
May 21, 1871, the great Rosse telescope showed the latter as
a most extraordinary object, at least 10′ in length and crossed
by several dark bands. Roberts photographed these nebulæ
on March 31, 1889. “The negative shows that the nucleus
[of M. 81], which has not a well-defined boundary, is surrounded
by rings of nebulous or meteoric matter, and that
the outermost rings are discontinuous in the N.p. and S.f.
directions.” M. 82 is “probably a nebula seen edgeways, with
several nuclei of a nebulous character involved, and the rifts
and attenuated places in it are the divisions of the rings that
would be visible as such if we could photograph the nebula
from the direction perpendicular to its plane” (‘Monthly
Notices,’ vol. xlix. p. 363). This fine pair may be easily
picked up in a small instrument. Another grand object
of this class (discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1783) lies in
R.A. 0<sup>h</sup> 42<sup>m</sup>·2, Dec.-25° 54´, between the stars β Ceti and
α Sculptoris.</p>

<p><i>Globular clusters</i> furnish us with many examples of easily
resolved and richly condensed balls of stars. M. 3 (discovered
by Messier), M. 5 (discovered by G. Kirch), and
M. 13 (discovered by Halley) may be selected as amongst the
finest of these objects in the northern hemisphere. They are
severally visible to the naked eye, and may be found in a
telescope directed as follows:—M. 3, between Arcturus and
Cor. Caroli, and nearer the former; M. 5, 7° S.W. of α Serpentis
and close to the double star 5 Serpentis; M. 13, one
third the distance from ζ to ζ Herculis. They are brilliant
objects from 5′ to 7′ diameter. With power 60 on my 10-inch
reflector they are spangled with stars, though not fully resolved.
Smyth described M. 3 as consisting of about 1000 small stars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
blazing splendidly towards the centre. Webb hardly resolved
it with a 3-7/10-inch refractor. Another fine object of this class
(M. 80) will be encountered midway between α and β Scorpii.
Sir W. Herschel described it as the richest and most compact
group of stars in the sky, and it is noteworthy from the fact
that a new star burst forth near its centre in 1860. There is
a magnificent cluster, involving ω Centauri, which Sir J.
Herschel considered as “beyond all comparison the richest
and largest object of the kind in the heavens.” It is visible
to the naked eye as a 4th mag. star, but residents in northern
latitudes are precluded from a view of it. Pegasus also
supplies us with some fine clusters; Maraldi picked up two in
1746 (M. 2 and 15), and these will respectively be found
5° N. of β and 4° W.N.W. of ε Pegasi. They are to be classed
amongst the grandest objects of their kind.</p>

<p>In Cygnus, at R.A. 20<sup>h</sup> 41<sup>m</sup> 7<sup>s</sup>, Dec. +30° 19′, near κ and
especially in the region immediately north-east, there exist
irregular and extensive streams of faint nebulosity which may
be said to form a telescopic milky way, Nebulæ and stars are
curiously grouped together, forming a remarkable arrangement
which will well repay study. To see these objects
satisfactorily, a moonless night, free from haze or fog, should
be chosen, and the power should be moderately low, or some
of the more feeble nebulous films will be lost. The observer
may spend some agreeable hours in sweeping over this region,
which is one of the best in a wonderfully rich constellation.</p>

<p><i>Further Observations.</i>—The fact that Swift has discovered
many hundreds of nebulæ during the last few years affords
indubitable proof that considerable numbers of these objects
still await detection. No doubt they are generally small and
faint, but it is necessary they should be observed and catalogued,
so that our knowledge in this department may be
rendered as complete as possible. New nebulæ are sometimes
mistaken for expected comets, and occasionally give rise to
misconceptions which would be altogether avoided were our
data more exhaustive.</p>

<p>Those who sweep for nebulæ must have the means of deter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>mining
positions, and a small telescope will be inadequate to
the work involved. A reflector of at least 10 inches, or
refractor of 8 inches, will be required; and a still larger
instrument is desirable, for to cope successfully with objects of
this faint character needs considerable grasp of light. The
power employed should be moderate; it must be high
enough to reveal a very small nebula, but not so high as to
obliterate a large, diffused, and faint nebula. In forming his
first catalogue of 1000 nebulæ, Sir W. Herschel used a Newtonian
reflector of 18·7 inches aperture, power 157, field
15′ 14″; Swift’s recent discoveries were effected with a
16-inch refractor and a periscopic positive eyepiece, power
132, field 33′. With a low power a very extensive field will
be obtained, and a large part of the sky may soon be examined,
but it will be done ineffectively. It is better to use a moderately
high power, and thoroughly sweep a small region. The
work is somewhat different to comet-seeking; it must proceed
more slowly and requires greater caution, for every field has
to be attentively and steadily scanned. If the telescope is
kept in motion, a faint nebula will pass unseen. Some of
these objects are so feeble that they are only to be glimpsed
by averted vision. When the eye is directed, say, to the
E. side, a faint momentary glow comes from the W. side of
the field; but the observer discerns nothing on looking
directly for the object. On again diverting his gaze he
receives another impression of faint nebulosity from the same
point as before, and becomes conscious of its reality. Frequently,
while comet-seeking, I meet with a small indefinite
object, the character of which cannot be determined by direct
scrutiny. On withdrawing the eye to another part of the
field, however, the mystery is solved. If the object is a
nebula, it flashes very distinctly on the retina; but if a
small cluster, the individual stars are seen sparkling in it.
These indirect views are usually so effective that the trouble
of applying higher powers is dispensed with.</p>

<p>The glow from a faint nebula or comet often apparently
fluctuates in a remarkable manner. Light-pulsations affect
it, causing the nebulosity to be intermittently visible. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
flashes out and enlarges, then becomes excessively feeble and
indeterminate. The changes are not real, but due to the
faint and delicate nature of the object, which is only fugitively
glimpsed and presents itself differently with the slightest
change in the manner of viewing it. Burnham has said
there is no such thing as glimpsing an object; but he is
wrong. It is the intermediate step between steady visibility
and absolute invisibility.</p>

<p>The work of sweeping for nebulæ is much delayed by the
comparisons necessary for the identification of objects. The
path may be smoothed by marking the known nebulæ on a
good chart, like Argelander’s. The observer may then see,
by reference, whether the objects he encounters have been
picked up before. The labour of projecting all the nebulæ
contained in the New General Catalogue would of course be
considerable, and the observer will probably find it expedient
to select certain regions for examination, and map such nebulæ
as are included within their borders.</p>

<p>The discovery of new nebulæ offers an inviting field to
amateurs. Vast numbers of these objects have escaped previous
observation, for though the sky has been swept again
and again, its stores have not been nearly exhausted. Mr.
Barnard recently stated that with the powers of the great 36-inch
refractor the number of known nebulæ (more than 8000)
might readily be doubled! As an example of their plentiful
distribution in certain regions it may be mentioned that
Mr. Burnham very recently discovered eighteen new nebulæ
in a small area of 16′ by 5′·5 near the position in R.A. 13<sup>h</sup> 38<sup>m</sup>,
Dec. 56° 20′ N. Near the pole of the northern heavens there
exist many unrecorded nebulæ, as this region does not appear to
have been thoroughly examined with a large instrument. It is
often the case that several nebulæ are clustered near together.
Whenever a new one is discovered the surrounding space
should therefore be carefully surveyed in search of others.
The region immediately outlying known objects may also be
regarded as prolific ground for new discoveries. After
several hours’ employment in the work of searching for
nebulæ or comets the eye is enabled to discern faint objects
which were invisible at first, as it is in a better condition to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
receive feeble impressions. While comet-seeking in 1889 and
1890 I discovered ten new nebulæ, all near the N. pole, and
their approximate positions are given below:—</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Large and Small Telescopes.</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>.—With reference to mountainous sites for large
instruments, a remark in Sir Isaac Newton’s ‘Opticks’
(1730) may be quoted:—“Telescopes ... cannot be formed
so as to take away that confusion of rays which arises from
the tremors of the atmosphere. The only remedy is a most
serene and quiet air, such as may perhaps be found on the
tops of the highest mountains above the grosser clouds.”</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>.—Lieut. Winterhalter, of the United States Navy,
recently visited a large number of European observatories,
and in describing that of Nice says:—“M. Perrotin declares
that two hours’ work with a large instrument is as fatiguing
as eight with a small one, the labour involved increasing
in proportion to the cube of the aperture, the chances of
seeing decreasing in the same ratio, while it can hardly be said
that the advantages increase in like proportion.” The Nice
Observatory, and its splendid instruments (including a 30-inch
refractor), are due to the munificence of M. Bischoffsheim, who
has expended about five million francs upon them.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_36">36</a>.—The large refractor to be erected on Wilson’s Peak
of the Sierra Madre range of mountains, in Southern California,
is to be 40 inches in diameter. The rough unground
disks of glass are already in the hands of the Clarkes, of
Cambridgeport, Mass. It is estimated that the complete
object-glass and cell will cost something like $65,000, and
the focal length of the instrument will be about 58 feet.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sun.</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_100">100</a>.—The last minimum of sun-spot frequency appears
to have occurred at the middle of 1889. Conspicuous spots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
were very rare in the first half of 1890, but some fine groups
were presented in the last half of the year. On Aug. 31
I saw a group extending over 113,000 miles in length, and
on Nov. 27 there was another, which measured 123,700 miles.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_111">111</a>.—Thompson’s cardboard disks have been favourably
spoken of as enabling observers to determine the positions of
spots at any season of the year.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mercury.</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_137">137</a>.—At the meeting of the British Astronomical
Association on Nov. 26, 1890, Mr. G. F. Chambers expressed
his firm belief in the existence of an intra-Mercurial planet.
The President (Capt. W. Noble) in his inaugural address
pointed out the desirability of effecting further observations,
both of Mercury and Venus, with a view to redetermine their
rotation-periods. He justly remarked that moderately small
instruments might be fittingly employed in the work, and
that Schiaparelli’s deductions (mentioned on pp. 142 and
149) ought to be accepted with extreme reserve pending
their verification.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mars.</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>.—Prof. W. H. Pickering observed some of the
canals on Mars in 1890 with a 12-inch refractor, but was not
able to double any of them. He says that, in examining
these objects, the power employed should not “exceed one
or two hundred.” This is quite contrary to the advice of
others, who recommend high magnifiers; and perhaps it
accounts for Prof. Pickering’s failure in recognizing the
duple canals.</p>

<p>With the great 36-inch refractor Mr. Keeler saw, on July 5
and 6, 1890, some curious white spots on the edges of the
gibbous limb of Mars, something similar to those visible on
the unilluminated part of the lunar disk. The canals were
observed as feeble diffused bands. The two satellites were
seen by a lady visitor, though previously unaware of their
existence.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_161">161</a>.—The method of deriving the rotation-period of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Mars is exemplified by Mr. Proctor in the ‘Monthly Notices,’
vol. xxviii. p. 38. An interesting paper, “On the Determination
of the Rotation-Period of Jupiter in 1835,” will be
found in the ‘Memoirs,’ vol. ix.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Planetoids.</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_167">167</a>.—The 308th planetoid was discovered by Charlois
on March 5, 1891.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jupiter.</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>.—Dupret, in Algiers, saw Jupiter with the naked
eye on Sept. 26, 1890, and following days, twenty minutes
before sunset.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_191">191</a>.—M. Guillaume, during a recent transit of the
shadow of Jupiter’s second satellite, observed a duplicate
shadow, fainter than the ordinary one, which partly covered
its southern side.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Comets.</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_250">250</a>.—On Nov. 16, 1890, Dr. Spitaler, while looking
for Zona’s Comet with the 27-inch refractor of the Vienna
Observatory, discovered a new and very faint comet only 23′
distant from the object of his search. That two of these
bodies should be found almost simultaneously and so near
together must be regarded as a very singular coincidence.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Meteors.</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_261">261</a>.—Mr. Proctor held the view that certain meteorites
may have originally been ejected from the Sun. A recent
writer thus summarizes our knowledge of them:—“That they
are independent bodies, moving in orbits of their own in
space; that these dark bodies are abundant in the interplanetary
spaces; that those within the near range of solar
or planetary attraction move with great velocity; that many
swarms of them follow well-known orbits; and that, in
general, their origin is undoubtedly the same as that of other
celestial bodies” (‘Sidereal Messenger,’ June 1890, p. 284).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_267">267</a>.—On May 2, 1890, a brilliant fireball, leaving a
long train of fire and smoke, and exploding with a noise like
thunder, was seen at many places in Northern Iowa, Minnesota,
U.S.A. Some fragments of the meteor fell on a farm a
few miles from the south line of Minnesota. The largest piece
was sold by auction for $100, but it soon transpired that the
person who sold it was only the lessee and not the owner of
the ground on which the meteor fell. The aerial visitor and
its purchase-money were therefore peremptorily seized by
legal authorities, pending the decision of a Court of Justice
as to the rightful ownership.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_267">267</a>.—On December 14, 1890, at 9<sup>h</sup> 42<sup>m</sup> a large fireball
of dazzling lustre, and giving a report like thunder, was
widely observed in the southern parts of England. At the
end-point the fireball appears to have been only 8 miles in
height, and over a point near Brentwood, in Essex.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_309">309</a>.—Prof. Chandler, of Cambridge, Mass., estimates
that the total number of variable stars visible with a common
field-glass is about 2000, but with a large telescope there are
probably hundreds of thousands within reach. He further
states that quite five sixths of the variable stars are reddish in
colour, and that the redness is usually a function of the length
of the period of variation. The redder the star the longer its
period.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_312">312</a>.—In a recent communication to the Academy of
Sciences, M. Lescarbault (the alleged discoverer of Vulcan in
1859) announced that on the night of January 11, 1891, he
discovered a bright body in Leo which he could not identify
in any star-map, and hence concluded it to be a new star, or
one suddenly increased in brilliancy. The “new star,”
however, subsequently turned out to be the planet Saturn!
This ridiculous mistake (so easily avoidable with a little care)
will naturally divest the supposed discovery of Vulcan of the
importance attached to it by some writers, for M. Lescarbault
obviously lacks the experience and caution necessary to
command credit.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_327">327</a>.—Mr. Roberts, from a comparison of his photographs,
has found distinct evidence of variability in the
nucleus of the great nebula in Andromeda. In some of the
photographs the nucleus is shown to be stellar, while in others
there is no trace of this. Mr. Roberts remarks:—“We may
reasonably infer that the nucleus of the nebula is variable,
and that it will be practicable to study the character of the
variability without the necessity of giving long exposures of
the plates.” The period of the variation has now to be determined,
and it is advisable that telescopic observations of the
nucleus should be made with the view of confirming the photographic
results. It would be premature to regard the
changes as demonstrated before they have been submitted to
thorough investigation.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_327">327</a>.—In the <i>Comptes Rendus</i> for March 2, 1891,
M. Bigourdan has a paper on the variability of the nebula
N.G.C. 1186, situated near Algol. This nebula was discovered
by Sir W. Herschel in 1785, and though Sir J.
Herschel re-observed it in 1831, Lord Rosse looked for it
without success in 1854 and 1864. On Nov. 8, 1863, D’Arrest
failed to detect the nebula, though he searched for it with
assiduity at a time when the sky was very favourable. He was
led to conclude that the object did not exist. M. Bigourdan
finds that the nebula is again visible in the position indicated
by the two Herschels, viz. R.A. 2<sup>h</sup> 54<sup>m</sup> 20<sup>s</sup>, Dec. +42° 10′,
he having observed it on Jan. 31 and Feb. 26, 1891. It is
difficult to believe that this object could have escaped the
scrutiny of Lord Rosse and D’Arrest in 1854, 1863, and
1864; hence the variation is probably real. The nebula
may be easily found, as it is very near the binary B.D. +42°
(1123 G.C.), the position of which for 1891 is R.A. 2<sup>h</sup> 58<sup>m</sup> 6<sup>s</sup>,
Dec. +42° 29’ (‘Nature,’ March 12, 1891).</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_329">329</a>.—While examining the Pleiades on the night of
November 14, 1890, Mr. Barnard discovered a new and
considerably bright, round, cometary nebula 36″ S. and 9″
following Merope. The reason why this nebula has not been
detected by photography is because it is so near Merope that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
the over-exposed light from the star obliterates it. But it is
certainly very strange that the object alluded to has never
been telescopically discovered before; for the Pleiades have
been scrutinized repeatedly with all sorts of telescopes, and
particularly since Tempel announced his discovery of a large
faint nebula involving Merope in 1859. Mr. Barnard says
the new nebula is 30″ in diameter, and that it is visible in a
12-inch refractor when Merope is hidden with a wire.</p>

Such objects show considerable glare in a very large instrument.
The advent of Jupiter into the field of the 6-foot has been compared to
the brightness of a coach-lamp. The outer satellite of Mars was seen twice
with this instrument in 1877, “but the glare of the planet was found too
strong to allow of good measures being taken.”</p></div>

The Rev. F. Howlett measured this spot on the following day,

The maximum duration of totality, under every favouring circumstance,
appears to be about 8 minutes. The great eclipse which
occurred on August 18, 1868, maintained the total phase for nearly
6 minutes 50 seconds in the Gulf of Siam. In reference to this eclipse,
Dr. Weiss says:—“In the records of ancient eclipses there are to be
found only two which may be compared in size with that of August 18,
1868, but none in which the totality lasted so long. The first of these is
the eclipse of Thales (28 May, 585 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), which is said to have been the
first predicted, and to have terminated a bloody war between the
Lydians and the Medes. The second was visible on June 17, 1433,
in Scotland, and the time of its occurrence was long remembered by the
people of that country as ‘the black hour.’”</p></div>

Herschel’s earlier observations were made in 1777-79, and his period,
like that of his predecessors, is about 2 min. in excess of the correct value;
but Mädler pointed out that, by giving Mars an additional rotation on his
axis, Herschel’s value will agree within 2 sec. of his own. Herschel
appears to have adopted 768 rotations instead of 769, and may have been
led to this by the excessive periods of Cassini and Maraldi and by the
want of intermediate data between his own observations in April 1777 and
May-June 1779. His second determination, made in 1784, is more
correct.</p></div>

The question of periodicity is an extremely interesting one as affecting
the disposition, form, and colours of the markings on Jupiter. Certain
features visible in 1869-70 were unmistakably reproduced in 1880, and it
has been suspected that the cycle of these changes accords with the length
of the Jovian year. Future observations must be compared with old
drawings and records for the identification of similar features if they are
recurrent.</p></div>

Schröter, Harding, Schwabe, and others have observed luminous
points on the rings, but they have remained stationary, so that the period
of rotation announced by Herschel has never been confirmed, but rather
disproved by counter-evidence. Herschel wrote, in November 1789:—“I
formerly supposed the surface of the ring to be rough, owing to
luminous points like mountains seen on the ring, till one of these supposed
luminous points was kind enough to venture off the edge of the ring and
appear as a satellite. I have always found these appearances to be due
to satellites.”</p></div>

Galle, at Berlin, had, twelve years previously, made an observation
which, if it had been interpreted correctly, would have given him
priority. In June 1838 he remarked, on several nights, that the inner
boundary of the inner ring was very indistinct and “gradually lost itself
towards the body of the planet.” The space between the ring and Saturn
was half filled with a dim veil, extending inwards from the ring. These
observations failed to attract the notice their importance deserved, and
Galle himself did not appreciate their full significance until the announcements
of Bond and Dawes in 1850.</p></div>

Newton conjectured that comets formed “the aliment by which
suns are sustained,” his opinion being that the former bodies finally
coalesced with the suns round which they revolved. He remarked:—“I
cannot say when the Comet of 1680 will fall into the Sun,—possibly
after five or six revolutions; but whenever that time shall arrive, the heat
of the Sun will be raised by it to such a point that our globe will be burnt
and all the animals upon it will perish.”</p></div>

Mr. George Knott, of Cuckfield, mentions that the radius of the first

and for one of 2 inches 3″·70 (‘Observatory,’ vol. vi. p. 19; see also vol. i.
pp. 107 and 145). Mr. Dawes is quoted as giving 1″·25 for a 7-inch,
1″·61 for a 5½-inch, and 3″·57 for a 2·4-inch. These figures exceed the
theoretical values, if the latter are adopted from Sir G. B. Airy’s ‘Undulatory
Theory of Optics,’ where, for mean rays, we have:—

The star α Canis Minoris (Procyon) was also inferred to be a binary
and to have a similar period. Several close companions appear to have
been discovered (Ast. Nach. no. 2080). But Prof. Hall, using the 25·8-inch
refractor at Washington, says:—“I have never been able to see any
of these companions that would stand the test of sliding and changing
the eyepiece, turning the micrometer, &amp;c., and am therefore doubtful of
their existence. This is an interesting star for the powerful telescopes of
the future.” It has been surmised that the companion is a non-luminous
one, and therefore invisible.</p></div>

Sir W. Herschel at first entertained this view, finding that with
every increase of telescopic power more nebulæ were resolved. But in
1791 he said, “perhaps it has been too hastily surmised that all milky
nebulosity is owing to starlight only.” Lacaille had remarked in 1755
that “it is not certain the whiteness of parts of the Milky Way is caused
by clusters of stars more closely packed together than in other parts of
the heavens.”</p></div>

Chambers says only four examples are known, but this is erroneous,

catalogued.</p></div>

Some of the nebulæ in Messier’s list were discovered by Mechain at
Paris, who, like Messier, earned celebrity by his cometary discoveries.
He was born at Laon in 1744, and died at Valencia in 1805.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
